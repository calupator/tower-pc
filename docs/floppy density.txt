                                  Head Trouble
                             Notes on PC Disk Drives
                    by Theo Clarke, BSL International Limited

        In our Bromley office we have a mixture of microcomputer hardware
        and  not  all of it is fully compatible. The  main  problem  lies
        between   the  differnt  types  of  disk  drive.  You  may   have
        experienced a brand new floppy suddenly developing 'bad  sectors'
        after being used for reliable recordings of data? Or you may have
        had  "General failure Error" from a diskette that works  fine  on
        another machine.

        This  can arise if you were using a high density (HD) disk  in  a
        low  density drive (or the other way round). High  density  disks
        need higher write current then low density disks. If you write to
        an  HD  disk in an ordinary drive the current will  not  be  high
        enough  to get reliable data storage. If you format  an  ordinary
        disk  to HD the current would be too high, and over a  period  of
        time  will lead to data migration across tracks (thus  corrupting
        the data).

        This  is nothing to do with the difference between  48tracks  per
        inch  and 96tpi. These disks are the same media but 96tpi  passed
        better  tests in the factory! HD disks are made from a  different
        material than SD and DD disks.

        Another problem is writing to the disk with a different drive. If
        it is a 360k disk which was formatted in a PC/XT (40track  drive)
        and  written  to  with a PC/XT all its life  there  would  be  no
        problem. When you WRITE to it in a PC/AT (80track drive) you  may
        start to get problems.  This is because the heads are smaller  in
        a  PC/AT,  so  only half the data is  over-written.  See  diagram
        below:

                       PC/XT tracks        PC/AT tracks

                       ################
        Track one      ################    ####################

                       ################
        Track two      ################    ####################


        As  you can see the PC/AT will overwrite only half the  data,  so
        when the PC/XT attempts to READ this data it gets old and new  at
        the  same time.  READING data will not give problems, so to  move
        data between machines two disks are needed:

        1. WRITE on with PC/XT ONLY - read with anything
        2. WRITE on with PC/AT ONLY - read with anything

        All  of  the low density disk drives in the  Bromley  office  are
        labelled but you may care to note that the Amstrad, the IBM PC/XT
        and the Walters all have low density drives whereas the IBM PC/AT
        and the Tandons have high density drives.
