<center><h1>The VGA card</h1></center>

I do not know a huge amount about the VGA card. I have spent my life writing graphics code
for one screen mode, and I have done a small amount in SuperVGA, so this information will
only get you started, and you'll have to go and get a big book of you really want to know
how to fiddle with it.<p>

<h2>Graphics Mode 13h</h2><p>

This is everyone's favourite graphics mode. It's extremely easy to use. Takes a couple of seconds
to learn how it all works. Right here goes<p>

The screen resolution is 320 pixels by 200 pixels. Therefore there are 64000 pixels visible on
the screen. Each one of these pixels is capable of showing one of 262144 different colours.
However, you may only ever have 256 different colours visible on screen at once. I shall explain
all in a sec.<p>

Every pixel on the screen is represented by one byte in the PC's memory. If you change the value
of that byte, the colour of the corresponding pixel will change immediately. Writing a pixel to
the screen, therefore, is simply a matter of working out which byte you need to change, and changing
it. <p>

The bytes are arranged in memory in order. They are arranged in the same order that you read
letters from a page. The top-left pixel comes first, followed by the one to its right . . . and
the next few . . . then the top-right pixel, then the one below the top-left one. . . and finally
the bottom-right pixel. <p>

So the pixels on the first line of the screen are numbered 0 to 319. The pixels on the next line
are numbered 320 to 639. etc.<p>

Understand that? Yer it's simple isn't it? OK, so here's a little bit of maths to convert a
pair of (x, y) co-ordinates to a byte location:<br>

<h4><ul>offset = (Y * 320) + X</ul></h4>

Of course, if you're programming in real mode, you'll need to know the segment all this is
taking place in. The segment is:

<h4><ul>A000h</ul></h4>

Now you have all the information you need to write pixels to the VGA card in mode 13h. Next
thing you'll need to know is how to mix your own colours.<p>

<h2>Palette Mixing</h2>

Because each pixel is represented by one byte, that gives us a maximum of 256 different
colours which can be displayed on screen at once. Exactly which colours these are depends on
the palette. You can choose any 256 colours from a selection of 262144. You choose the colours
by literally mixing red, green, and blue light.<p>

For each of the 256 colour values, you choose how much red, green, and blue light you want the
screen to give out. By mixing these colours in various amounts, you can create almost all the
colours the eye can see.<br>
<h4>Note:</h4> This is not quite the same as mixing paints. Mixing red and blue paint will
produce purple, and the same applies for light. However, mixing yellow and blue paint produces
green, but mixing red and green light produces yellow. Mixing all three colours of paint produces
almost black, but all three colours of light gives white. <p>

<h4>Getting the colours you want</h4>
There are various ways of assigning Red, Green, Blue values to a colour number. There is an
interrupt to do it, but interrupts are slow, and there is a much faster way to acheive it.
The VGA card has two ports for choosing colours. They are numbered 968 and 969. The way to mix
your colours is this:<p>

send a byte to port 968. This is the pixel value you want to assign red, green and blue values
to. Next send 3 bytes to port 969. First the red, then the green then the blue value. The
range of colour you are allowed is 0 to 63.<p>

<h4>for example:<p>
send 15 to port 968<br>
send 63 to port 969<br>
send 40 to port 969<br>
send 0 to port 969<br>
</h4>

This will assign orange to colour number 15. So every time you plot a pixel with value 15 to
the screen it will be orange.<p>

now, if you do this:<p>
<h4>
send 15 to port 968<br>
send 30 to port 969<br>
send 30 to port 969<br>
send 63 to port 969<br>
</h4>

All those orange pixels will turn light blue.<p>

And there you have it. Nothing could be simpler.
