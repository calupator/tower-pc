<h4>Page 4: Switch to the Graphics Mode</h4>
<p><tr><td colspan=2><hr></td></tr><p>

Switching to your chosen resolution is the easiest of all the functions in the VESA BIOS. All
you have to do is tell it the mode you want, and it does the rest. This will only work, of course,
if you ask for a mode the BIOS has explicitly told you it supports. <p>

<h4>Request Mode Change</h4>
<pre>
   AX = 4F02h
   BX = mode number

   call interrupt 10h
</pre>
<h4>Chesk it was sucessful</h4>
<pre>
   if AX = 4F00h then
      continue the program
   else
      print "Could not switch to that mode"
   end if
</pre>
