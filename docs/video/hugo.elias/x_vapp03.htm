Right, now this isn't always necessary, and there's no need to bother doing this unless you
really need to. For example if you were writing a popup TSR or something. However, most programs
will just want to drop back into DOS in mode 3.<p>

What has to be done here is to ask the graphics card how much memory it would require to save
its current state. I.E. its resolution, virtual screen width, palette etc. You can actually choose
what parts of the state are saved by setting bits in the CX register.<p>

CX bit 0: Hardware state<br>
CX bit 1: BIOS data state<br>
CX bit 2: DAC state<br>
CX bit 3: SuperVGA state<p>

The BIOS replies, telling you how many blocks of 64 bytes it needs.<br>
You must then allocate enough memory to hold the buffer.<br>
And lastly, call the BIOS again to save the state.<p>

All the requesting buffer sizes, saving and restoring are handled by the same function, Function 04h.<br>
It is split up into 3 sub functions:<p>

subfunction 00h: Request buffer size<br>
subfunction 01h: Save state<br>
subfunction 02h: Restore state<p>

Right here's some pseudo code which will save the video state, and then restore it again:<p>

<h4>Firstly ask it how much memory we need:</h4>
<pre>
   AH = 4Fh        ;Super VGA support
   AL = 04h        ;Function 04h (save state)
   DL = 00h        ;Subfunction 00h (request amount of memory needed)
   CX = 00001111b  ;save everything please

   call interrupt 10h
</pre>
<h4>Next allocate enough memory to hold the buffer, and save the state</h4>
<pre>
   SaveBuffer = AllocateMemory (BX * 64) bytes

   AH = 4Fh        ;Super VGA support
   AL = 04h        ;Function 04h (save state)
   DL = 01h        ;Subfunction 01h (save the state)
   CX = 00001111b  ;save everything please
   ES:[DI] -> SaveBuffer

   call interrupt 10h
</pre>
