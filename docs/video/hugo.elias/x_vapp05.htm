<h1>VESA BIOS Example</h1>
<h4>Page 5: Change the Virtual Screen Width</h4>
<p><tr><td colspan=2><hr></td></tr><p>

Right, we're going to want this program to do some scrolling around, so we'll make the virtual
screen twice the width of the physical screen. The width of the virtual screen is also known
as the Logican Scan Line Length.<p>

This is done using Function 06h. You can ask it to set the width to anything you like, but it
won't always be able to do it for you. This could be for various reasons, hardware considerations,
or there may not be enough memory. If it is unable to set the width you require, it will set it
to the next highest it can. Whatever the result, it will tell you what width it has been set to.
It will also tell you the maximum number of scanlines possible with the amount of RAM on the
graphics card, And it will tell you how many bytes each scanline uses.

You can either tell it to set the width, or you can ask it what the current width is.<p>

<h4>Set Logical Scan Line Length</h4>
<pre>
   AX = 4F06h		; Function 06h
   BL = 00h        	; Subfunction 00h (select Scan Line Length)
   CX = DesiredWidth

   call interrupt 10h

   BytesPerScanLine = BX
   LogicalWidth = CX
   MaxScans = DX

   if LogicalWidth not= DesiredWidth then
      print "could not set virtual screen to desired width."
      print "it has been set to ", LogicalWidth, " instead"
   end if

   print "the maximum number of scanlines available is ", MaxScans
   print "each scanline takes up ", BytesPerScanLine, " bytes"
</pre>

<h4>Request current Logical Scan Line Length</h4>

<pre>
   AX = 4F06h		; Function 06h
   BL = 01h        	; Subfunction 01h (request scanline length)

   BytesPerScanLine = BX
   LogicalWidth = CX
   MaxScans = DX
</pre>
