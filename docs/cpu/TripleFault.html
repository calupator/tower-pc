<H1>Triple Faulting the CPU</H1>

<H2>*** We owe our thanks ***</H2>

<H4>A word of warning to all of you people who have known how to do this
for years, and now read this and think of yourself as really cool. Triple-faulting
the CPU to trigger a SHUTDOWN cycle was the brain-child of Intel. Just
look in the first edition of the 80286 Programmer's Reference Manual --
Appendix -A and you will find it there. IBM took the next logical step
and included circuitry in the IBM-AT which would assert RESET when a triple-fault
was detected. Even though Intel gave this to IBM on a silver-platter, and
IBM put in the RESET circuitry, the IBM software engineers didn't connect
the dots, and realize that this could be very useful for getting out of
protected mode. Instead, IBM put in that kludgy keyboard controller command
to assert RESET to get out of protected mode. Then one day, a friend of
mine (Mike Meisner of MR BIOS) was having a problem with this new Intel
AboveBoard which had the new 80386 on it. This board plugged into an ISA
slot, but had a cable which converted the 80386 bus signals to 80286-compatible
signals. Mike didn't want to use the keyboard controller to get out of
protected mode, because he knew it was very slow. So he noticed the triple-fault
method mentioned in the Intel manual, and tried it on the 80286. Much to
his surprise, it was much faster than the keyboard controller. Now the
problem was the AboveBoard. This board didn't propogate the shutdown cycle
to the 80286 bus. So working with a collegue, (Rhod Williams), Mike and
Rhod connected all of the dots and gave us the following elegant RESET
technique. Mike is now the sole proprietor of Microid Research (MR BIOS).
Rhod Williams is now a director of Engineering at Phoenix Technologies.</H4>

<P>If the processor encounters an exception while trying to invoke an exception
handler, a DOUBLE FAULT exception occurs. This can rarely occur, but is
possible. For example, if the invocation of an exception causes the stack
to overflow, then this would cause a double fault. This is a bad example
of a double fault, because the same condition that caused the double fault
obviously still persists, and the CPU will fail to invoke the double fault
exception handler. When this happens, the CPU will triple fault and cause
a SHUTDOWN cycle to occur. This special cycle should be interpreted by
the motherboard hardware, who then pulls RESET, which ultimately resets
the CPU and the computer.</P>

<P>Triple faulting the CPU can be useful for testing purposes, and in production
code. Generating a triple fault is useful for test purposes to test that
the special SHUTDOWN cycle is recognized by the hardware, and appropriately
resets the CPU. In production code, triple faulting the CPU is an effective
way to force the CPU out of protected mode. Since the 80286 has no way
of exiting protected mode, IBM defined a keyboard controller command to
reset the system. Unfortunately the keyboard controller responds slowly
to the command and the reset takes many hundred micro-seconds. Triple faulting
the CPU is about 1/3 faster than using the keyboard controller method (your
mileage may vary depending on how and where you drive).</P>

<P>Understanding how to triple fault the CPU leads to writing elegant assembly
language code that will take both the 80286 and 80386 (and above) out of
protected mode in the manner best suited to each. Unlike the example stated
above, there is a very elegant way to triple fault the '286, while simply
returning the '386 from protected mode in its native manner. To do this,
we need to first generate a DOUBLE FAULT, and guarantee that its generation
will cause the desired TRIPLE FAULT. Easy! Load the interrupt descriptor
table register (IDTR) with a value whose limit=0. Then generate an interrupt!
Loading IDTR with a value whose limit=0, will guarantee that the invocation
of ANY interrupt will triple fault the CPU. The CPU won't be able to service
the first interrupt because the limit is too small. This itself causes
an interrupt -- DOUBLE FAULT. Since the same condition still persists,
a TRIPLE FAULT occurs, and resets the CPU. How do you do this in practice?
