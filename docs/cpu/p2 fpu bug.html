<hr>

<p><font size="3">Just two days before its biggest processor
announcement in years, Intel was hit by reports of a math bug in
its Pentium Pro and (the soon to be announced) Pentium II
processors. The bad timing prompted reports that the bug
disclosure was deliberately timed to coincide with the Pentium II
announcement, thereby maximizing the embarrassment to Intel.
Another early rumor put AMD behind the bug report. Yet another
industry rumor said that the Pentium II used for the tests was
illegally obtained. As intriguing as these theories may be, none
of them are true. How do I know? Because I wrote the bug report.
The bug was known as the Dan-0411 bug by the news media and
Internet community. Intel had its own name for it - the Flag
Erratum. </font></p>

        <td valign="top" width="40%"><h2><font color="#FF0000">The
        Facts </font></h2>
        <p><font size="3">I received e-mail from &quot;Dan&quot;
        who asked if I could reproduce what he thought was a bug
        in the Pentium Pro. After contemplating my involvement
        for ten days, I finally decided to help out (see the
        accompanying text box). I wrote an assembly-language
        program that checked into the problem. I ran the test on
        Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium classic (P54C), Pentium
        MMX (P55C), and AMD K6 processors. (I had purchased the
        Pentium II over the counter at Fry's Electronics in
        Sunnyvale, California, six weeks before its official
        introduction. There was nothing illegal about the
        acquisition of the Pentium II processor.) After running
        the test on these various processors, I came to the
        conclusion that a bug did exist in the Pentium Pro and
        Pentium II. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Why Dan-0411? These days, astronomers
        name new stars and comets by combining the discoverer's
        name and some number. Why should microprocessor bugs be
        different? In this case, &quot;Dan&quot; is the
        discoverer of the bug, and 04-11 (1997) is the date on
        which I got my first e-mail about it. So I've named the
        bug &quot;Dan - 0411&quot; after its discoverer and the
        date he first reported it to me. (Please refer to </font><a

        size="3"> for the text of the original bug announcement.)
        </font></p>
        <h2><font color="#FF0000">What is the Bug and What Does
        it Affect?</font> </h2>
        <p><font size="3">The bug relates to operations that
        convert floating-point numbers into integer numbers. All
        floating-point numbers are stored inside of the
        microprocessor in an 80-bit format. Even though the
        external representation of a number may not be an 80-bit
        format, once the number is loaded into the
        microprocessor, it is converted to an 80-bit format.
        Integer numbers are stored externally in two different
        sizes. A short integer is stored in 16 bits, and a long
        integer is stored in 32 bits. It is often desirable to
        store the floating-point numbers as integer numbers. On
        occasion, the converted numbers won't fit into the
        smaller integer format. This is when the bug occurs. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The host software are is supposed to be
        warned by the microprocessor when such a floating-point
        conversion error occurs; a specific error flag is
        supposed to be set in a floating-point status register.
        If the microprocessor fails to set this flag, it does not
        comply with the IEEE Floating Point Standards, which
        mandate such behavior. For the Dan-0411 bug, the Pentium
        II and Pentium Pro fail to set this error flag in many
        cases. It is interesting to note that a launch failure of
        the Ariane 5 rocket, which happened less than a minute
        into the launch, was traced to behavior around an
        overflow condition. In this case, it was a software bug,
        not a microprocessor bug, that caused the problem. One of
        the computers on board had a floating-point to integer
        conversion that had overflowed. The overflow was not
        expected and, therefore, not detected by the computer
        software. As a result, the computer did a dump of its
        memory. Unfortunately, this memory dump was interpreted
        by the rocket as instructions to its rocket nozzles.
        Result: Boom! </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The case of the Ariane rocket is a
        sensational example of the drastic consequences of an
        unhandled float-to-integer overflow. Pentium Pro and
        Pentium II users, on the other hand, are most likely to
        see the results of this bug in their graphics displays or
        in heavy-duty numerical analysis programs. Intel says
        ordinary users might see a temporary screen glitch on
        some games when this bug occurs. </font></p>
        <h2><font color="#FF0000">The Nature of the Bug </font></h2>
        <p><font size="3">The Dan-0411 bug occurs when a large
        negative floating-point number is stored to memory in an
        integer format. Under normal operation, the largest
        negative integer (MAXNEG) is stored in memory when a
        floating-point number is too large to fit in the integer
        format. The FPU Status Word is supposed to indicate that
        an Invalid Operand Exception (#IE) occurred (FSW.IE = 1).
        Floating-point numbers that overflow the &quot;real
        number&quot; format are supposed to behave differently
        than floating-point numbers that overflow the
        &quot;integer number&quot; format. Float-to-real
        overflows are supposed to set the overflow flag
        (FSW.OE=1); Float-to-integer overflows are supposed to
        set the Invalid Operand Exception flag (FSW.IE). Section
        7.8.4 of the <u>Pentium Pro Family Developer's Manual,
        Volume 2</u> makes this difference quite clear: </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Float-to-real overflows: </font></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2">The FPU reports a floating-point
            numeric overflow exception (#O) whenever the rounded
            result of an arithmetic instruction exceeds the
            largest allowable Finite value that will fit into the
            real format of the destination operand. For example,
            if the destination format is extended-real (80 bits),
            overflow occurs when the rounded result falls outside
            the unbiased range of -1.0 x 2<sup>16384</sup> to 1.0
            x 2<sup>16384</sup> (exclusive). Numeric overflow can
            occur on arithmetic operations where the result is
            stored in an FPU data register. It can also occur on
            store real operations (with the FST and FSTP
            instructions), where a within-range value in a data
            register is stored in memory in a single-or
            double-real format. The overflow threshold range for
            the single-real format is -1.0 x 2<sup>128</sup> to
            1.0 x 2<sup>128</sup>, the range for the double-real
            format is -1.0 x 2<sup>1024</sup> to 1.0 x 2<sup>1024</sup>.</font>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="3">Float-to-integer overflows: </font></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2">The numeric overflow exception
            cannot occur when overflow occurs when storing values
            in an integer or BCD integer format. Instead, the
            invalid-arithmetic-operand exception is signaled. </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="3">Instead of setting the Invalid Operand
        Exception (FSW.IE) bit, only the precision exception
        (FSW.PE) bit is set. The precision-exception flag
        indicates that a computation can't be precisely
        represented by the floating-point operation - in this
        case, the float-to-integer store operation. In most
        cases, this bit is ignored by programmers. Therefore,
        when the conditions are met for the Dan-0411 bug to
        occur, programmers may never know that an error occurred.
        If that isn't bad enough, it gets worse. The Dan - 0411
        bug occurs for three out of four rounding modes, and when
        exceptions are either masked or unmasked. In the case of
        masked exceptions, the correct value is stored to memory;
        only the Floating-Point Status Word (FSW) is incorrectly
        set. For unmasked exceptions, the errant behavior is more
        serious. </font></p>
        <ul>
            <li><font size="3">No exception occurs. The
                floating-point exception handler is not invoked.
                Therefore, the errant condition is undetectable. </font></li>
            <li><font size="3">MAXNEG is returned to memory.
                Storing MAXNEG to memory is an errant condition.
                When exceptions are unmasked, nothing is supposed
                to he stored to memory. This means the
                microprocessor is spuriously storing data to
                memory when no data is expected. </font></li>
            <li><font size="3">In the case of the FISTP
                instruction, the floating-point value is popped
                from the floating-point stack. When exceptions
                are unmasked, the floating-point stack is
                supposed to remain unchanged to allow for error
                recovery. In this case, the value is popped from
                the stack and gone forever. Even if the errant
                condition was detectable, it would be
                unrecoverable after the FISTP instruction. </font></li>

                about the bug. The first comes from an
                &quot;investor&quot; with a British accent who
                only cares about the authenticity of the Usenet
                report. After I try to explain the possible
                insignificance of the bug, he says &quot;I don't
                care, I'm investor,&quot; then promptly hangs up.
                Fifteen minutes later, I receive a second phone
                call - this time from a man claiming to be an
                attorney. He claims to represent clients who file
                class-action product-defect lawsuits. I don't
                bite his bait and become suspicious. I ask who
                his client is and why he's poking around this bug
                issue. The &quot;lawyer&quot; becomes defensive
                and refuses to tell me who he works for or to
                explain his interest in this bug report. Finally,
                he threatens me with a libel lawsuit if I can t
                prove that a math bug really exists in the
                Pentium Pro and Pentium II. I automatically
                assume that this lawyer is somehow connected with
                the investor who called me a few minutes earlier.
                This just couldn't be a coincidence. </p>
                <p>Unnerved by the phone call, I call my contact

                involved. He promises to keep the attorneys off
                my back. He uses the opportunity to press me for
                further details about the bug. Again I decline,
                citing my lack of Dan's permission to give him

                attempts are made to discredit the bug report or
                to minimize it. </p>
                <p><b>Tuesday, May 6</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b>,
                1997.</b> The bug report shows up in various
                print publications. The online publications
                report the bug as a top story, eclipsing Intel's
                Pentium II announcement. Reports start surfacing
                that I'm getting revenge on Intel for its legal
                action against me. (No legal action ever
                occurred.) Another report surfaces that AMD is
                behind the bug report. Another report surfaces
                that this bug report was calculated to be timed
                with the Pentium II announcement (even though a
                rudimentary analysis of the chronology that
                appeared in the original article would have
                refuted such claims). </p>
                <p>Two industry analysts downgrade Intel's stock
                from &quot;buy&quot; to &quot;neutral&quot;
                because of the bug report. After an initial surge
                in Intel's stock price, it loses five points to
                close near $162 per share. My web site receives
                an all-time record of 503,989 hits. </p>
                <p><b>Wednesday, May 7</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b>,
                1997.</b> I get a private e-mail from a guy (I'll
                call Mr. X) who claims that I may have made a
                mistake in my bug analysis. He claims that the
                bug may be much more severe than I had originally
                reported. He also claims to have spoken with me
                in the week prior, and that he's an investor in
                AMD, but not selling short on Intel stock.
                (Strange set of information) Within minutes, CNet
                sends me e-mail asking me to confirm this guy's
                claims. I wonder how CNet got a copy of this
                e-mail, and become suspicious. CNet claims Mr. X
                sent them a copy of his e-mail to me. </p>
                <p>Intel's stock loses three more points to close
                under $160 per share. My web site receives
                345,531 hits. </p>
                <p>Later that night, I call CNet and ask a few
                questions of my own. I want to know how they
                learned of this story - reporting it three days
                before their competition. They tell me Mr. X
                tipped them off. </p>
                <p><b>Thursday, May 8</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b>,
                1997.</b> I confirm the claims by Mr. X. My
                original article contained an ambiguous paragraph
                that minimized the severity of the bug. I fixed
                the ambiguity and called CNet to confirm Mr. X's
                claims. By now, I m a little suspicious of Mr. X,
                and I wonder if CNet has actually talked to him.
                They confirm they have, and tell me he's got a
                British accent. I become convinced that Mr. X is
                the same investor who called me on May 1<sup>st</sup>.
                Both have a British accent and both claim to have
                spoken to me. </p>
                <p>After I confirm the ambiguity in my original
                report, a second round of press reporting is
                sparked. Now, everybody's reporting that the bug
                is more severe than originally anticipated. Intel
                stock starts to regain some lost ground, closing
                near $161 per share. My web site receives 262,937
                hits. </p>
                <p><b>Friday, May 9</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b>,
                1997.</b> I go on vacation I need to get away. </p>
                <p>Intel posts its response after the stock
                market closes. The bug is much more severe than
                originally discovered during my analysis. </p>
                <p>I get a phone call from a representative of
                Senator Torricelli's (D-NJ) office in Washington,
                DC, telling me about legislation introduced in
                the Senate that I might be interested in (not
                related to the bug, though). He mentions that my
                web site is reasonably well known in the Capitol.
                Intel stock continues to inch back up, closing
                near $162 per share. My web site receives 234,809
                hits. </p>
                <p><b>Saturday, May 10</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b>,
                1997.</b> I appear on a computer radio show.
                Afterwards, life gets back to normal. The stock
                market is closed for the weekend. My web site
                receives 120,072 hits. Slowly, my web site
                traffic returns to normal, though &quot;normal
                traffic&quot; appears to he more than double the
                level it was before the bug was reported. My 15
                minutes of fame are now over. </p>

<h2><font color="#FF0000" size="5">Why Wasn't this Bug Detected
Before? </font></h2>

<p><font size="3">I'm not sure why this bug wasn't detected
sooner, but there are clues that could help provide an
explanation. Professor William Kahan of the University of
California, Berkeley, has written a suite of floating-point test
programs in FORTRAN (see </font><a
href="http://http.%20cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/"><font size="3">http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/</font></a><font
size="3">). These programs are commonly used to test the
Float-to-Integer Store instructions (FIST and FISTP). Dan ported
Dr. Kahan's FORTRAN programs to C and ran the tests against the
Pentium Pro - this is when the bug came to light. So in the end,
either Intel failed to run Dr. Kahan's test on the Pentium Pro,
misconfigured the program, or a FORTRAN compiler hid the bug in
the chip. </font></p>

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.x86.org/source/fistbug/fistbug.asm"><font
size="3">Source code</font></a><font size="3"> and two executable

first program, </font><a

size="3">FISTBUG.EXE</font></a><font size="3">, demonstrates the
bug in a straightforward manner. When you run the program, all
that appears on the screen is either the simple message &quot;***
Dan-0411 bug found. ***&quot;, or &quot;Dan-0411 not found.&quot;
The second program, </font><a
href="ftp://ftp.x86.org/source/fistbug/fistbugv.exe"><font
size="3">FISTBUGV.EXE</font></a><font size="3">, runs the same
exact tests as the first, but is much more verbose. This program
shows the microprocessor stepping information and itemized
results. Each operand under test is printed to the screen, along
with pass/fail status for four different testing methods.</font></p>
