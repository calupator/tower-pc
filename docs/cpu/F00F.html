        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Last fall, a message
        warning users or a bug in the Pentium/Pentium MMX was
        anonymously posted on the comp.os.linux.advocacy</font><font
        color="#00FF00" size="3" face="Arial"> </font><font
        size="3" face="Arial">Internet newsgroup. According to
        the message, the bug could completely lock up the
        computer from any operating mode in any operating system.
        At first glance, the ordinary news reader might say
        &quot;so what.&quot; After all, many users are accustomed
        to Windows 3.1/95 regularly locking up. But the placement
        of the bug on comp.os.linux.advocacy was calculated and
        intentional. The readers on that newsgroup knew exactly
        what the bug meant &#150; an ordinary user or saboteur
        could unleash a program to bring down network servers
        that form the backbone of our modern networking
        community. Internet service providers (ISPs), web hosts,
        government agencies, and computer departments at
        universities were petrified of the potential damage that
        this bug could do. </font></p>
        <h3><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial">Enter the
        F00F Bug </font></h3>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When any x86 processor
        from the 80186 and beyond encounters an invalid
        instruction, the processor is<i> supposed</i> to generate
        an invalid opcode exception. In Intel vernacular, the
        undefined opcode exception is known as a &quot;#UD.&quot;
        This handler usually signals an error condition and
        terminates the errant program. When this mechanism works,
        the errant program can&#146;t harm the computer system.
        Should this mechanism fail, however, the errant program
        can bring down the entire computer. If the computer is a
        network server or ISP, then the errant program can bring
        down the entire network. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">That&#146;s what can, in
        fact, happen when the Pentium encounters the
        &quot;F00F&quot; bug, which maps to a LOCK CMPXCHG8B EAX
        instruction. CMPXCHGHB compares 64-hit memory contents
        with the contents in EDX and EAX. One of the operands
        must he memory, and the other (implied) operand is
        EDX:EAX. It is possible to construct an instruction
        encoding that doesn&#146;t map to a memory operand. Since
        the non-memory form of this instruction is invalid, a
        compiler or assembler will not generate this code.
        Instead, assembly-language programmers must construct it
        by hand. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Such an illegal encoding
        should generate the requisite #UD. As you&#146;d expect,
        a CMPXCHG8B EAX instruction generates a #UD. However,
        when this illegal encoding is prepended with a LOCK
        prefix, the processor fails to work correctly. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Using the LOCK prefix on
        this form of CMPXCHG8B is illegal in and of itself. LOCK
        prefixes are only allowed on memory-based
        read-modify-write instructions. Hence a LOCK prefix on
        the register-based CMPXCHG8B EAX instruction should also
        generate an invalid opcode exception. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Instead, the Pentium locks
        up and freezes the entire computer when it encounters
        this instruction. This bug is especially nasty, because
        any user can construct a program with this instruction,
        and upload it to a network computer, or incorporate it
        within an ActiveX applet. Once the program is run on the
        network, the network server crashes. The only possible
        recovery comes by hitting the big red switch. Suppose you
        download an ActiveX applet that contains this code. As
        soon as the code executes,<i> your</i> computer freezes
        up. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Within one week of the
        discovery of the bug, Intel announced a software
        workaround that can be incorporated into virtually any
        operating system (except real-mode operating systems,
        like DOS). </font></p>
        <h3><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Arial">How the
        Bug Works </font></h3>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">When the processor
        encounters the instruction F0 0F C7 C8 (or anything from
        F0 0F C7 C8..CF), the F00F bug occurs. The processor
        recognizes that an invalid opcode has occurred and tries
        to dispatch the #UD handler. Because of the LOCK prefix,
        the processor is confused. When the processor issues the
        bus reads to get the #UD handler vector address, the
        processor erroneously asserts the LOCK#</font><font
        color="#FF0000" size="3" face="Arial"> </font><font
        size="3" face="Arial">signal. The LOCK# signal can only
        he asserted for read-modify-write instructions that
        modify memory. When the bus is locked, a locked memory
        read must be followed by a locked memory write, lest
        unpredictable results may occur. But in this case, the
        LOCK#</font><font color="#FF0000" size="3" face="Arial"> </font><font
        size="3" face="Arial">signal remains asserted for the two
        consecutive memory reads required to retrieve the #UD
        vector address. The processor never issues any
        intervening locked write, and then hangs itself. This
        behavior is shown in the logic analyzer trace in </font><a
        href="#Ex1"><font size="3" face="Arial">Example 1</font></a><font
        size="3" face="Arial">. As you can see, the Pentium tries
        to retrieve the #UD vector with two locked reads. After
        that, all processor activity stops. </font></p>

        workarounds to this bug &#150; not all of them are good
        (a few are outright kludgey, in fact). One workaround
        Intel has proposed actually takes advantage of the
        bug&#146;s behavior as a means to do the right thing.
        Another Intel workaround is ingenious, though a kludge.
        The first two <b><u>alternate</u></b> workarounds, to be
        presented shortly, are given for academic purposes only.

        receives any of the first seven exceptions (Divide by
        Zero through Invalid Opcode), the processor generates a
        page fault instead of the appropriate exception. The
        page-fault handler gets mucked up with all kinds of code
        to check privilege levels and whether the fault was
        caused by another exception. If I had my druthers,

        size="3" face="Arial">as a means to provide a fix to the
        problem. When any of the first six exceptions occur, they
        are handled as they normally would. Divide by Zero
        through BOUND exceptions vector to their normal exception
        handlers without any intervening code in the page-fault
        handler. However, when the F00F bug occurs, the
        page-fault handler is invoked instead of the #UD handler.
        Why? CR0.WP=1 instructs the microprocessor to generate a
        page fault when an attempt is made by the supervisor to
        modify a memory page. The processor doesn&#146;t actually
        attempt to modify the Interrupt Descriptor Page (IDT page
        holding the #UD vector address) when the F00F opcode is
        encountered. But the bug actually makes the processor
        think it&#146;s modifying the IDT page with the #UD
        vector. The locked memory cycle somehow convinces the
        internal state of the Pentium to think that a write cycle
        is going to occur. Since the transition to the #UD
        handler is considered a supervisor task, the processor
        thinks it&#146;s going to write to this page. Thus when
        CR0.WP=1, a page fault occurs. </font></p>

        </font></h3>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The ultimate solution to
        the F00F bug problem is obtained when disabling the cache
        &#150; indicating that some interaction exists between
        the cache and the bug. Instead of taking advantage of the
        cache interaction, Intel&#146;s second solution takes
        advantage of interaction between the bug and page-fault
        mechanism. Now that Intel has set the precedent of using
        the bug behavior as a workaround, nobody should be
        concerned by the two more elegant solutions provided
        herein. My second alternate solution is by far the best.
        The exception handlers don&#146;t need to be mucked up
        with extra code, and the processor performance isn&#146;t
        impacted in the slightest. Note, however, that neither of
        these two alternate workarounds have been thoroughly
        tested in production code. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">I&#146;ve written two
        programs so that you can examine this bug and the various
        workarounds: F00FBUG.EXE, which demonstrates all five
        workarounds for the bug, and F00FBUG2.EXE, which
        demonstrates the most elegant workaround &#150; Alternate
        Solution #2. The source code and executables for both
        programs are available electronically from </font><a
