12.2  Debug Registers
</h2>
<p>
Six 80386 registers are used to control debug features. These registers are
accessed by variants of the MOV instruction. A debug register may be either
the source operand or destination operand. The debug registers are
privileged resources; the MOV instructions that access them can only be
executed at privilege level zero. An attempt to read or write the debug
registers when executing at any other privilege level causes a general
protection exception. Figure 12-1 shows the format of the debug registers.

<h3>12.2.1  Debug Address Registers (DR0-DR3)</h3>
<p>
Each of these registers contains the linear address associated with one of
four breakpoint conditions. Each breakpoint condition is further defined by
bits in DR7.
<p>
The debug address registers are effective whether or not paging is enabled.
The addresses in these registers are linear addresses. If paging is enabled,
the linear addresses are translated into physical addresses by the
processor's paging mechanism (as explained in Chapter 5). If paging is not
enabled, these linear addresses are the same as physical addresses.
<p>
Note that when paging is enabled, different tasks may have different
linear-to-physical address mappings. When this is the case, an address in a
debug address register may be relevant to one task but not to another. For
this reason the 80386  has both global and local enable bits in DR7. These
bits indicate whether a given debug address has a global (all tasks) or
local (current task only) relevance.
<p>

<h3>12.2.2  Debug Control Register (DR7)</h3>
<p>
The debug control register shown in Figure 12-1 both helps to define the
debug conditions and selectively enables and disables those conditions.
<p>
For each address in registers DR0-DR3, the corresponding fields R/W0
through R/W3 specify the type of action that should cause a breakpoint. The
processor interprets these bits as follows:
<p>
<pre>
   00 -- Break on instruction execution only
   01 -- Break on data writes only
   10 -- undefined
   11 -- Break on data reads or writes but not instruction fetches
</pre>
Fields LEN0 through LEN3 specify the length of data item to be monitored. A
length of 1, 2, or 4 bytes may be specified. The values of the length fields
are interpreted as follows:
<p>
<pre>
   00 -- one-byte length
   01 -- two-byte length
   10 -- undefined
   11 -- four-byte length
</pre>
If RWn is 00 (instruction execution), then LENn should also be 00. Any other
length is undefined.
<p>
The low-order eight bits of DR7 (L0 through L3 and G0 through G3)
selectively enable the four address breakpoint conditions. There are two
levels of enabling: the local (L0 through L3) and global (G0 through G3)
levels. The local enable bits are automatically reset by the processor at
every task switch to avoid unwanted breakpoint conditions in the new task.
The global enable bits are not reset by a task switch; therefore, they can
be used for conditions that are global to all tasks.
<p>
The LE and GE bits control the "exact data breakpoint match" feature of the
processor. If either LE or GE is set, the processor slows execution so that
data breakpoints are reported on the instruction that causes them. It is
recommended that one of these bits be set whenever data breakpoints are
armed. The processor clears LE at a task switch but does not clear GE.

<h3>12.2.3  Debug Status Register (DR6)</h3>
<p>
The debug status register shown in Figure 12-1 permits the debugger to
determine which debug conditions have occurred.
<p>
When the processor detects an enabled debug exception, it sets the
low-order bits of this register (B0 thru B3) before entering the debug
exception handler. Bn is set if the condition described by DRn, LENn, and
R/Wn occurs. (Note that the processor sets Bn regardless of whether Gn or
Ln is set. If more than one breakpoint condition occurs at one time and if
the breakpoint trap occurs due to an enabled condition other than n, Bn may
be set, even though neither Gn nor Ln is set.)
<p>
The BT bit is associated with the T-bit (debug trap bit) of the TSS (refer
to 7 for the location of the T-bit). The processor sets the BT bit before
entering the debug handler if a task switch has occurred and the T-bit of
the new TSS is set. There is no corresponding bit in DR7 that enables and
disables this trap; the T-bit of the TSS is the sole enabling bit.
<p>
The BS bit is associated with the TF (trap flag) bit of the EFLAGS
register. The BS bit is set if the debug handler is entered due to the
occurrence of a single-step exception. The single-step trap is the
highest-priority debug exception; therefore, when BS is set, any of the
other debug status bits may also be set.
<p>
The BD bit is set if the next instruction will read or write one of the
eight debug registers and ICE-386 is also using the debug registers at the
same time.
<p>
Note that the bits of DR6 are never cleared by the processor. To avoid any
confusion in identifying the next debug exception, the debug handler should
move zeros to DR6 immediately before returning.

<h3>12.2.4  Breakpoint Field Recognition</h3>
<p>
The linear address and LEN field for each of the four breakpoint conditions
define a range of sequential byte addresses for a data breakpoint. The LEN
field permits specification of a one-, two-, or four-byte field. Two-byte
fields must be aligned on word boundaries (addresses that are multiples of
two) and four-byte fields must be aligned on doubleword boundaries
(addresses that are multiples of four). These requirements are enforced by
the processor; it uses the LEN bits to mask the low-order bits of the
addresses in the debug address registers. Improperly aligned code or data
breakpoint addresses will not yield the expected results.
<p>
A data read or write breakpoint is triggered if any of the bytes
participating in a memory access is within the field defined by a breakpoint
address register and the corresponding LEN field. Table 12-1 gives some
examples of breakpoint fields with memory references that both do and do not
cause traps.
<p>
To set a data breakpoint for a misaligned field longer than one byte, it
may be desirable to put two sets of entries in the breakpoint register such
that each entry is properly aligned and the two entries together span the
length of the field.
<p>
Instruction breakpoint addresses must have a length specification of one
byte (LEN = 00); other values are undefined. The processor recognizes an
instruction breakpoint address only when it points to the first byte of an
instruction. If the instruction has any prefixes, the breakpoint address
must point to the first prefix.
