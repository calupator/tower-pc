6.4  Page-Level Protection
</h2>
<p>
Two kinds of protection are related to pages:
<p>
<pre>
  1.  Restriction of addressable domain.
  2.  Type checking.

<h3>6.4.1  Page-Table Entries Hold Protection Parameters</h3>
<p>
Figure 6-10 highlights the fields of PDEs and PTEs that control access to
pages.

<h3>6.4.1.1  Restricting Addressable Domain</h3>
<p>
The concept of privilege for pages is implemented by assigning each page to
one of two levels:
<p>
<pre>
  1.  Supervisor level (U/S=0) -- for the operating system and other systems
      software and related data.

  2.  User level (U/S=1) -- for applications procedures and data.
</pre>
The current level (U or S) is related to CPL.  If CPL is 0, 1, or 2, the
processor is executing at supervisor level. If CPL is 3, the processor is
executing at user level.
<p>
When the processor is executing at supervisor level, all pages are
addressable, but, when the processor is executing at user level, only pages
that belong to the user level are addressable.
<p>

<h3>6.4.1.2  Type Checking</h3>
<p>
At the level of page addressing, two types are defined:
<p>
<pre>
  1.  Read-only access (R/W=0)
  2.  Read/write access (R/W=1)
</pre>
When the processor is executing at supervisor level, all pages are both
readable and writable. When the processor is executing at user level, only
pages that belong to user level and are marked for read/write access are
writable; pages that belong to supervisor level are neither readable nor
writable from user level.

<h3>6.4.2  Combining Protection of Both Levels of Page Tables</h3>
<p>
For any one page, the protection attributes of its page directory entry may
differ from those of its page table entry. The 80386 computes the effective
protection attributes for a page by examining the protection attributes in
both the directory and the page table.  Table 6-5 shows the effective
protection provided by the possible combinations of protection attributes.

<h3>6.4.3  Overrides to Page Protection</h3>
<p>
Certain accesses are checked as if they are privilege-level 0 references,
even if CPL = 3:
<p>
<pre>
  -  LDT, GDT, TSS, IDT references.
  -  Access to inner stack during ring-crossing CALL/INT.
</pre>
