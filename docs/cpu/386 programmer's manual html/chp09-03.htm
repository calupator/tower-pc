<h2>
9.3  Priority Among Simultaneous Interrupts and Exceptions
</h2>
<p>
If more than one interrupt or exception is pending at an instruction
boundary, the processor services one of them at a time. The priority among
classes of interrupt and exception sources is shown in Table 9-2. The
processor first services a pending interrupt or exception from the class
that has the highest priority, transferring control to the first
instruction of the interrupt handler. Lower priority exceptions are
discarded; lower priority interrupts are held pending. Discarded exceptions
will be rediscovered when the interrupt handler returns control to the point
of interruption.
