Customer Support
</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Customer Support is Intel's complete support service that provides Intel
customers with hardware support, software support, customer training, and
consulting services. For more information contact your local sales offices.
<p>
After a customer purchases any system hardware or software product,
service and support become major factors in determining whether that
product will continue to meet a customer's expectations. Such support
requires an international support organization and a breadth of programs
to meet a variety of customer needs. As you might expect, Intel's customer
support is quite extensive. It includes factory repair services and
worldwide field service offices providing hardware repair services,
software support services, customer training classes, and consulting
services.
<p>
Hardware Support Services

Intel is committed to providing an international service support package
through a wide variety of service offerings available from Intel Hardware
Support.

Software Support Services

Intel's software support consists of two levels of contracts. Standard
support includes TIPS (Technical Information Phone Service), updates and
subscription service (product-specific troubleshooting guides and COMMENTS
Magazine). Basic support includes updates and the subscription service.
Contracts are sold in environments which represent product groupings
(i.e., iRMX environment).

aspects of system design and implementation. In just three to ten days a
limited number of individuals learn more in a single workshop than in
weeks of self-study. For optimum convenience, workshops are scheduled
regularly at Training Centers woridwide or we can take our workshops to
you for on-site instruction. Covering a wide variety of topics, Intel's
major course categories include: architecture and assembly language,
