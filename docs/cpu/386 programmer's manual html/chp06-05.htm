<h2>
6.5  Combining Page and Segment Protection
</h2>
<p>
When paging is enabled, the 80386 first evaluates segment protection, then
evaluates page protection. If the processor detects a protection violation
at either the segment or the page level, the requested operation cannot
proceed; a protection exception occurs instead.
<p>
For example, it is possible to define a large data segment which has some
subunits that are read-only and other subunits that are read-write.  In this
case, the page directory (or page table) entries for the read-only subunits
would have the U/S and R/W bits set to x0, indicating no write rights for
all the pages described by that directory entry (or for individual pages).
This technique might be used, for example, in a UNIX-like system to define
a large data segment, part of which is read only (for shared data or ROMmed
constants). This enables UNIX-like systems to define a "flat" data space as
one large segment, use "flat" pointers to address within this "flat" space,
yet be able to protect shared data, shared files mapped into the virtual
space, and supervisor areas.

NOTE
  S -- Supervisor
  R -- Read only
  U -- User
  W -- Read and Write
  x indicates that when the combined U/S attribute is S, the R/W attribute
  is not checked.
