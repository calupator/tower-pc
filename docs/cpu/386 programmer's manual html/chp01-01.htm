1.1  Organization of This Manual
</h2>

This book presents the architecture of the 80386 in five parts:
<pre>
   Part I      -- Applications Programming
   Part II     -- Systems Programming
   Part III    -- Compatibility
   Part IV     -- Instruction Set
   Appendices
</pre>
These divisions are determined in part by the architecture itself and in
part by the different ways the book will be used. As the following table
indicates, the latter two parts are intended as reference material for
programmers actually engaged in the process of developing software for the
80386. The first three parts are explanatory, showing the purpose of
architectural features, developing terminology and concepts, and describing
instructions as they relate to specific purposes or to specific
architectural features.<br>
<pre>
Explanation                Part I   -- Applications Programming
                           Part II  -- Systems Programming
                           Part III -- Compatibility

Reference                  Part IV  -- Instruction Set
                           Appendices
</pre>
The first three parts follow the execution modes and protection features of
the 80386 CPU. The distinction between applications features and systems
features is determined by the protection mechanism of the 80386. One purpose
of protection is to prevent applications from interfering with the operating
system; therefore, the processor makes certain registers and instructions
inaccessible to applications programs. The features discussed in Part I are
those that are accessible to applications; the features in Part II are
available only to systems software that has been given special privileges or
in unprotected systems.
<p>
The processing mode of the 80386 also determines the features that are
accessible. The 80386 has three processing modes:</p>
<pre>
   1.  Protected Mode.
   2.  Real-Address Mode.
   3.  Virtual 8086 Mode.
</pre><p>
Protected mode is the natural 32-bit environment of the 80386 processor. In
this mode all instructions and features are available.
<p>
Real-address mode (often called just "real mode") is the mode of the
processor immediately after RESET. In real mode the 80386 appears to
programmers as a fast 8086 with some new instructions. Most applications of
the 80386 will use real mode for initialization only.
<p>
Virtual 8086 mode (also called V86 mode) is a dynamic mode in the sense
that the processor can switch repeatedly and rapidly between V86 mode and
protected mode. The CPU enters V86 mode from protected mode to execute an
8086 program, then leaves V86 mode and enters protected mode to continue
executing a native 80386 program.
<p>
The features that are available to applications programs in protected mode
and to all programs in V86 mode are the same. These features form the
content of Part I. The additional features that are available to systems
software in protected mode form Part II. Part III explains real-address
mode and V86 mode, as well as how to execute a mix of 32-bit and 16-bit
programs.</p>

<h3>1.1.1  Part I -- Applications Programming</h3>
<p>
This part presents those aspects of the architecture that are customarily
used by applications programmers.
<p>
Chapter 2 -- Basic Programming Model: Introduces the models of memory
organization. Defines the data types. Presents the register set used by
applications. Introduces the stack. Explains string operations. Defines the
parts of an instruction. Explains addressing calculations. Introduces
interrupts and exceptions as they may apply to applications programming.
<p>
Chapter 3 -- Application Instruction Set: Surveys the instructions commonly
used for applications programming. Considers instructions in functionally
related groups; for example, string instructions are considered in one
section, while control-transfer instructions are considered in another.
Explains the concepts behind the instructions. Details of individual
instructions are deferred until Part IV, the instruction-set reference.
</p>
<a name="01-01-02"></a>
<h3>1.1.2  Part II -- Systems Programming</h3>
<p>
This part presents those aspects of the architecture that are customarily
used by programmers who write operating systems, device drivers, debuggers,
and other software that supports applications programs in the protected mode
of the 80386.
<p>
Chapter 4 -- Systems Architecture: Surveys the features of the 80386 that 
are used by systems programmers. Introduces the remaining registers and data
structures of the 80386 that were not discussed in Part I. Introduces the
systems-oriented instructions in the context of the registers and data
structures they support. Points to the chapter where each register, data
structure, and instruction is considered in more detail.
<p>
Chapter 5 -- Memory Management: Presents details of the data structures,
registers, and instructions that support virtual memory and the concepts of
segmentation and paging. Explains how systems designers can choose a model
of memory organization ranging from completely linear ("flat") to fully
paged and segmented.
<p>
Chapter 6 -- Protection: Expands on the memory management features of the
80386 to include protection as it applies to both segments and pages.
Explains the implementation of privilege rules, stack switching, pointer
validation, user and supervisor modes. Protection aspects of multitasking
are deferred until the following chapter.
<p>
Chapter 7 -- Multitasking: Explains how the hardware of the 80386 supports
multitasking with context-switching operations and intertask protection.
<p>
Chapter 8 -- Input/Output: Reveals the I/O features of the 80386, including
I/O instructions, protection as it relates to I/O, and the I/O permission
map.
<p>
Chapter 9 -- Exceptions and Interrupts: Explains the basic interrupt
mechanisms of the 80386. Shows how interrupts and exceptions relate to
protection. Discusses all possible exceptions, listing causes and including
information needed to handle and recover from the exception.
<p>
Chapter 10 -- Initialization: Defines the condition of the processor after
RESET or power-up. Explains how to set up registers, flags, and data
structures for either real-address mode or protected mode. Contains an
example of an initialization program.
<p>
Chapter 11 -- Coprocessing and Multiprocessing: Explains the instructions
and flags that support a numerics coprocessor and multiple CPUs with shared
memory.
<p>
Chapter 12 -- Debugging: Tells how to use the debugging registers of the
80386.

<h3>1.1.3  Part III -- Compatibility</h3>
<p>
Other parts of the book treat the processor primarily as a 32-bit machine,
omitting for simplicity its facilities for 16-bit operations. Indeed, the
80386 is a 32-bit machine, but its design fully supports 16-bit operands and
addressing, too. This part completes the picture of the 80386 by explaining
the features of the architecture that support 16-bit programs and 16-bit
operations in 32-bit programs. All three processor modes are used to
execute 16-bit programs: protected mode can directly execute 16-bit 80286
protected mode programs, real mode executes 8086 programs and real-mode
80286 programs, and virtual 8086 mode executes 8086 programs in a
multitasking environment with other 80386 protected-mode programs. In
addition, 32-bit and 16-bit modules and individual 32-bit and 16-bit
operations can be mixed in protected mode.
<p>
Chapter 13 -- Executing 80286 Protected-Mode Code: In its protected mode,
the 80386 can execute complete 80286 protected-mode systems, because 80286
capabilities are a subset of 80386 capabilities.
<p>
Chapter 14 -- 80386 Real-Address Mode: Explains the real mode of the 80386
CPU. In this mode the 80386 appears as a fast real-mode 80286 or fast 8086
enhanced with additional instructions.
<p>
Chapter 15 -- Virtual 8086 Mode: The 80386 can switch rapidly between its
protected mode and V86 mode, giving it the ability to multiprogram 8086
programs along with "native mode" 32-bit programs.
<p>
Chapter 16 -- Mixing 16-Bit and 32-Bit Code: Even within a program or task,
the 80386 can mix 16-bit and 32-bit modules. Furthermore, any given module
can utilize both 16-bit and 32-bit operands and addresses.

<h3>1.1.4  Part IV -- Instruction Set</h3>
<p>
Parts I, II, and III present overviews of the instructions as they relate
to specific aspects of the architecture, but this part presents the
instructions in alphabetical order, providing the detail needed by
assembly-language programmers and programmers of debuggers, compilers,
operating systems, etc. Instruction descriptions include algorithmic
description of operation, effect of flag settings, effect on flag settings,
effect of operand- or address-size attributes, effect of processor modes,
and possible exceptions.

<h3>1.1.5  Appendices</h3>
<p>
The appendices present tables of encodings and other details in a format
designed for quick reference by assembly-language and systems programmers.
