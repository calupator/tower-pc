<h2>
7.3  Task Register
</h2>
<p>
The task register (TR) identifies the currently executing task by pointing
to the TSS. Figure 7-3 shows the path by which the processor accesses the
current TSS.
<p>
The task register has both a "visible" portion (i.e., can be read and
changed by instructions) and an "invisible" portion (maintained by the
processor to correspond to the visible portion; cannot be read by any
instruction). The selector in the visible portion selects a TSS descriptor
in the GDT. The processor uses the invisible portion to cache the base and
limit values from the TSS descriptor. Holding the base and limit in a
register makes execution of the task more efficient, because the processor
does not need to repeatedly fetch these values from memory when it
references the TSS of the current task.
<p>
The instructions LTR and STR are used to modify and read the visible
portion of the task register. Both instructions take one operand, a 16-bit
selector located in memory or in a general register.
<p>
LTR (Load task register) loads the visible portion of the task register
with the selector operand, which must select a TSS descriptor in the GDT.
LTR also loads the invisible portion with information from the TSS
descriptor selected by the operand. LTR is a privileged instruction; it may
be executed only when CPL is zero. LTR is generally used during system
initialization to give an initial value to the task register; thereafter,
the contents of TR are changed by task switch operations.
<p>
STR (Store task register) stores the visible portion of the task register
in a general register or memory word. STR is not privileged.
