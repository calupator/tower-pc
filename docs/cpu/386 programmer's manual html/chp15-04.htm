15.4  Additional Sensitive Instructions
</h2>
<p>
When the 80386 is executing in V86 mode, the instructions PUSHF, POPF,
INT n, and IRET are sensitive to IOPL. The instructions IN, INS, OUT, and
OUTS, which are ordinarily sensitive in protected mode, are not sensitive
in V86 mode. Following is a complete list of instructions that are sensitive
in V86 mode:
<p>
<pre>
   CLI     -- Clear Interrupt-Enable Flag
   STI     -- Set Interrupt-Enable Flag
   LOCK    -- Assert Bus-Lock Signal
   PUSHF   -- Push Flags
   POPF    -- Pop Flags
   INT n   -- Software Interrupt
   RET     -- Interrupt Return
</pre>
CPL is always three in V86 mode; therefore, if IOPL < 3, these instructions
will trigger a general-protection exceptions. These instructions are made
sensitive so that their functions can be simulated by the V86 monitor.

<h3>15.4.1  Emulating 8086 Operating System Calls</h3>
<p>
INT n is sensitive so that the V86 monitor can intercept calls to the
8086 OS. Many 8086 operating systems are called by pushing parameters onto
the stack, then executing an INT n instruction. If IOPL < 3, INT n
instructions will be intercepted by the V86 monitor. The V86 monitor can
then emulate the function of the 8086 operating system or reflect the
interrupt back to the 8086 operating system in V86 mode.

<h3>15.4.2  Virtualizing the Interrupt-Enable Flag</h3>
<p>
When the processor is executing 8086 code in a V86 task, the instructions
PUSHF, POPF, and IRET are sensitive to IOPL so that the V86 monitor can
control changes to the interrupt-enable flag (IF). Other instructions that
affect IF (STI and CLI) are IOPL sensitive both in 8086 code and in
80386/80386 code.
<p>
Many 8086 programs that were designed to execute on single-task systems set
and clear IF to control interrupts. However, when these same programs are
executed in a multitasking environment, such control of IF can be
disruptive. If IOPL is less than three, all instructions that change or
interrogate IF will trap to the V86 monitor. The V86 monitor can then
control IF in a manner that both suits the needs of the larger environment
and is transparent to the 8086 program.
