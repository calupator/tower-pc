14.4  Entering and Leaving Real-Address Mode
</h2>
<p>
Real-address mode is in effect after a signal on the RESET pin. Even if the
system is going to be used in protected mode, the start-up program will
execute in real-address mode temporarily while initializing for protected
mode.

<h3>14.4.1  Switching to Protected Mode</h3>
<p>
The only way to leave real-address mode is to switch to protected mode. The
processor enters protected mode when a MOV to CR0 instruction sets the PE
(protection enable) bit in CR0. (For compatibility with the 80286, the LMSW
instruction may also be used to set the PE bit.)
<p>
Refer to Chapter 10 "Initialization" for other aspects of switching to
protected mode.
