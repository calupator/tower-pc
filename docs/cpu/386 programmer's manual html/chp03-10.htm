<h2>
3.10  Segment Register Instructions
</h2>
<p>
This category actually includes several distinct types of instructions.
These various types are grouped together here because, if systems designers
choose an unsegmented model of memory organization, none of these
instructions is used by applications programmers. The instructions that deal
with segment registers are:
<p>
1.  Segment-register transfer instructions.
<p>
<pre>
   MOV SegReg, ...
   MOV ..., SegReg
   PUSH SegReg
   POP SegReg
</pre>
2.  Control transfers to another executable segment.
<p>
<pre>
   JMP far    ; direct and indirect
   CALL far
   RET far
</pre>
3.  Data pointer instructions.
<p>
<pre>
   LDS
   LES
   LFS
   LGS
   LSS
</pre>
Note that the following interrupt-related instructions are different; all
are capable of transferring control to another segment, but the use of
segmentation is not apparent to the applications programmer.

INT n
INTO
BOUND
IRET

<h3>3.10.1  Segment-Register Transfer Instructions</h3>
<p>
The MOV, POP, and PUSH instructions also serve to load and store segment
registers. These variants operate similarly to their general-register
counterparts except that one operand can be a segment register. MOV cannot
move segment register to a segment register. Neither POP nor MOV can place a
value in the code-segment register CS; only the far control-transfer
instructions can change CS.

<h3>3.10.2  Far Control Transfer Instructions</h3>
<p>
The far control-transfer instructions transfer control to a location in
another segment by changing the content of the CS register.
<p>
Direct far JMP. Direct JMP instructions that specify a target location
outside the current code segment contain a far pointer. This pointer
consists of a selector for the new code segment and an offset within the new
segment.
<p>
Indirect far JMP. Indirect JMP instructions that specify a target location
outside the current code segment use a 48-bit variable to specify the far
pointer.
<p>
Far CALL. An intersegment CALL places both the value of EIP and CS on the
stack.
<p>
Far RET. An intersegment RET restores the values of both CS and EIP which
were saved on the stack by the previous intersegment CALL instruction.

<h3>3.10.3  Data Pointer Instructions</h3>
<p>
The data pointer instructions load a pointer (consisting of a segment
selector and an offset) to a segment register and a general register.
<p>
LDS (Load Pointer Using DS) transfers a pointer variable from the source
operand to DS and the destination register. The source operand must be a
memory operand, and the destination operand must be a general register. DS
receives the segment-selector of the pointer. The destination register
receives the offset part of the pointer, which points to a specific location
within the segment.
<p>
Example: LDS ESI, STRING_X
<p>
Loads DS with the selector identifying the segment pointed to by a
STRING_X, and loads the offset of STRING_X into ESI.  Specifying ESI as the
destination operand is a convenient way to prepare for a string operation on
a source string that is not in the current data segment.
<p>
LES (Load Pointer Using ES) operates identically to LDS except that ES
receives the segment selector rather than DS.
<p>
Example: LES EDI, DESTINATION_X
<p>
Loads ES with the selector identifying the segment pointed to by
DESTINATION_X, and loads the offset of DESTINATION_X into EDI. This
instruction provides a convenient way to select a destination for a string
operation if the desired location is not in the current extra segment.
<p>
LFS (Load Pointer Using FS) operates identically to LDS except that FS
receives the segment selector rather than DS.
<p>
LGS (Load Pointer Using GS) operates identically to LDS except that GS
receives the segment selector rather than DS.
<p>
LSS (Load Pointer Using SS) operates identically to LDS except that SS
receives the segment selector rather than DS.  This instruction is
especially important, because it allows the two registers that identify the
stack (SS:ESP) to be changed in one uninterruptible operation.  Unlike the
other instructions which load SS, interrupts are not inhibited at the end
of the LSS instruction.  The other instructions (e.g., POP SS) inhibit
interrupts to permit the following instruction to load ESP, thereby forming
an indivisible load of SS:ESP.  Since both SS and ESP can be loaded by LSS,
there is no need to inhibit interrupts.
