14.2  Registers and Instructions
</h2>
<p>
The register set available in real-address mode includes all the registers
defined for the 8086 plus the new registers introduced by the 80386: FS, GS,
debug registers, control registers, and test registers. New instructions
that explicitly operate on the segment registers FS and GS are available,
and the new segment-override prefixes can be used to cause instructions to
utilize FS and GS for address calculations. Instructions can utilize 32-bit
operands through the use of the operand size prefix.
<p>
The instruction codes that cause undefined opcode traps (interrupt 6)
include instructions of the protected mode that manipulate or interrogate
80386 selectors and descriptors; namely, VERR, VERW, LAR, LSL, LTR, STR,
LLDT, and SLDT. Programs executing in real-address mode are able to take
advantage of the new applications-oriented instructions added to the
architecture by the introduction of the 80186/80188, 80286 and 80386:
<p>
- New instructions introduced by 80186/80188 and 80286.
<p>
<pre>
   -- PUSH immediate data
   -- Push all and pop all (PUSHA and POPA)
   -- Multiply immediate data
   -- Shift and rotate by immediate count
   -- String I/O
   -- ENTER and LEAVE
   -- BOUND
</pre>
- New instructions introduced by 80386.
<p>
<pre>
   -- LSS, LFS, LGS instructions
   -- Long-displacement conditional jumps
   -- Single-bit instructions
   -- Bit scan
   -- Double-shift instructions
   -- Byte set on condition
   -- Move with sign/zero extension
   -- Generalized multiply
   -- MOV to and from control registers
   -- MOV to and from test registers
   -- MOV to and from debug registers
</pre>
