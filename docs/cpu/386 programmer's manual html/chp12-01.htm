12.1  Debugging Features of the Architecture
</h2>
<p>
The features of the 80386 architecture that support debugging include:
<p>
Reserved debug interrupt vector
<p>
Permits processor to automatically invoke a debugger task or procedure when
an event occurs that is of interest to the debugger.
<p>
Four debug address registers
<p>
Permit programmers to specify up to four addresses that the CPU will
automatically monitor.
<p>
Debug control register
<p>
Allows programmers to selectively enable various debug conditions
associated with the four debug addresses.
<p>
Debug status register
<p>
Helps debugger identify condition that caused debug exception.
<p>
Trap bit of TSS (T-bit)
<p>
Permits monitoring of task switches.
<p>
Resume flag (RF) of flags register
<p>
Allows an instruction to be restarted after a debug exception without
immediately causing another debug exception due to the same condition.
<p>
Single-step flag (TF)
<p>
Allows complete monitoring of program flow by specifying whether the CPU
should cause a debug exception with the execution of every instruction.
<p>
Breakpoint instruction
<p>
Permits debugger intervention at any point in program execution and aids
debugging of debugger programs.
<p>
Reserved interrupt vector for breakpoint exception
<p>
Permits processor to automatically invoke a handler task or procedure upon
encountering a breakpoint instruction.
<p>
These features make it possible to invoke a debugger that is either a
separate task or a procedure in the context of the current task. The
debugger can be invoked under any of the following kinds of conditions:
<p>
<pre>
  -  Task switch to a specific task.
  -  Execution of the breakpoint instruction.
  -  Execution of every instruction.
  -  Execution of any instruction at a given address.
  -  Read or write of a byte, word, or doubleword at any specified address.
  -  Write to a byte, word, or doubleword at any specified address.
  -  Attempt to change a debug register.
