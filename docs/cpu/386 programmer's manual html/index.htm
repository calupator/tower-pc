<h2>Intel 80386
Programmers Reference Manual</h2>
<h3>1986</h3>
<b>(This is not an official Intel document)</b>
</center>

<h3>Origins</h3>
The original source of this manual (INTEL386.TXT), as far as I can tell,
is an official Intel source document.
I found the original document somewhere on the net (I don't remember where).<br>
<br>
Get it here (212K):

<br>
This hypertext version of the source document, obviously, is not an official
Intel document or product.

<h3>Viewing</h3>
This manual may be viewed online, or downloaded to your PC and viewed
there.  I'd suggest downloading it and using it offline - much faster.<br>

<br>
When using the manual offline (or online for that matter),
start your browser at either the title page or the table of contents.<br>
<br>
Title page: <a href="manual.htm"><code>manual.htm</code></a><br>
<br>
Table of contents: <a href="toc.htm"><code>toc.htm</code></a><br>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
I converted the manual to HTML because:<br>
(1) I needed a basic 80x86 instruction reference,<br>
(2) the latest and greatest format of the manuals are huge PDF
files (on the order of 3-4meg each) and are a pain to sift thru
with Acrobat,<br>
(3) I thought it would be a fun project.

<h3>Character Set</h3>
This manual uses the line drawing character set.  Set the fixed width
character set in your browser to MS LineDraw (this works in Netscape 2+).
Read the <a href="about.htm">About This Manual</a> section for more info.

<h3>Conversion Process<br>
Do It Yourself</h3>
The <a href="about.htm">About This Manual</a> section also contains info
about the conversion, and how you can do it yourself starting with
the original text file.  Believe it or not, the entire process takes
less that 2 minutes to convert INTEL386.TXT to over 130 .HTM files.
