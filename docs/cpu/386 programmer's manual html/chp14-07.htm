<h2>
14.7  Differences From 8086
</h2>
<p>
In general, the 80386 in real-address mode will correctly execute ROM-based
software designed for the 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188. Following is a list
of the minor differences between 8086 execution on the 80386 and on an 8086.
<p>
<ol>
 <li> Instruction clock counts.
 <br>
      The 80386 takes fewer clocks for most instructions than the 8086/8088.
      The areas most likely to be affected are:
 <ul>
    <li> Delays required by I/O devices between I/O operations.

    <li> Assumed delays with 8086/8088 operating in parallel with an 8087.
 </ul>
 <li> Divide Exceptions Point to the DIV instruction.
 <br>
      Divide exceptions on the 80386 always leave the saved CS:IP value
      pointing to the instruction that failed. On the 8086/8088, the CS:IP
      value points to the next instruction.

 <li> Undefined 8086/8088 opcodes.
 <br>
      Opcodes that were not defined for the 8086/8088 will cause exception
      6 or will execute one of the new instructions defined for the 80386.

 <li> Value written by PUSH SP.
 <br>
      The 80386 pushes a different value on the stack for PUSH SP than the
      8086/8088. The 80386 pushes the value of SP before SP is incremented
      as part of the push operation; the 8086/8088 pushes the value of SP
      after it is incremented. If the value pushed is important, replace
      PUSH SP instructions with the following three instructions:
<pre>
      PUSH  BP
      MOV   BP, SP
      XCHG  BP, [BP]
</pre>
      This code functions as the 8086/8088 PUSH SP instruction on the 80386.

 <li> Shift or rotate by more than 31 bits.
 <br>
      The 80386 masks all shift and rotate counts to the low-order five
      bits. This MOD 32 operation limits the count to a maximum of 31 bits,
      thereby limiting the time that interrupt response is delayed while
      the instruction is executing.

 <li> Redundant prefixes.
 <br>
      The 80386 sets a limit of 15 bytes on instruction length. The only
      way to violate this limit is by putting redundant prefixes before an
      instruction. Exception 13 occurs if the limit on instruction length
      is violated. The 8086/8088 has no instruction length limit.

 <li> Operand crossing offset 0 or 65,535.
 <br>
      On the 8086, an attempt to access a memory operand that crosses
      offset 65,535 (e.g., MOV a word to offset 65,535) or offset 0 (e.g.,
      PUSH a word when SP = 1) causes the offset to wrap around modulo
      65,536. The 80386 raises an exception in these cases--exception 13 if
      the segment is a data segment (i.e., if CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS is being
      used to address the segment), exception 12 if the segment is a stack
      segment (i.e., if SS is being used).

 <li> Sequential execution across offset 65,535.
 <br>
      On the 8086, if sequential execution of instructions proceeds past
      offset 65,535, the processor fetches the next instruction byte from
      offset 0 of the same segment. On the 80386, the processor raises
      exception 13 in such a case.

 <li> LOCK is restricted to certain instructions.
 <br>
      The LOCK prefix and its corresponding output signal should only be
      used to prevent other bus masters from interrupting a data movement
      operation. The 80386 always asserts the LOCK signal during an XCHG
      instruction with memory (even if the LOCK prefix is not used). LOCK
      may only be used with the following 80386 instructions when they
      update memory: BTS, BTR, BTC, XCHG, ADD, ADC, SUB, SBB, INC, DEC,
      AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and NEG. An undefined-opcode exception
      (interrupt 6) results from using LOCK before any other instruction.

 <li> Single-stepping external interrupt handlers.
 <br>
      The priority of the 80386 single-step exception is different from that
      of the 8086/8088. The change prevents an external interrupt handler
      from being single-stepped if the interrupt occurs while a program is
      being single-stepped. The 80386 single-step exception has higher
      priority that any external interrupt. The 80386 will still single-step
      through an interrupt handler invoked by the INT instructions or by an
      exception.

 <li> IDIV exceptions for quotients of 80H or 8000H.
 <br>
      The 80386 can generate the largest negative number as a quotient for
      the IDIV instruction. The 8086/8088 causes exception zero instead.

 <li> Flags in stack.
 <br>
      The setting of the flags stored by PUSHF, by interrupts, and by
      exceptions is different from that stored by the 8086 in bit positions
      12 through 15. On the 8086 these bits are stored as ones, but in
      80386 real-address mode bit 15 is always zero, and bits 14 through 12
      reflect the last value loaded into them.

 <li> NMI interrupting NMI handlers.
 <br>
      After an NMI is recognized on the 80386, the NMI interrupt is masked
      until an IRET instruction is executed.

 <li> Coprocessor errors vector to interrupt 16.
 <br>
      Any 80386 system with a coprocessor must use interrupt vector 16 for
      the coprocessor error exception. If an 8086/8088 system uses another
      vector for the 8087 interrupt, both vectors should point to the
      coprocessor-error exception handler.

 <li> Numeric exception handlers should allow prefixes.
 <br>
      On the 80386, the value of CS:IP saved for coprocessor exceptions
      points at any prefixes before an ESC instruction. On 8086/8088
      systems, the saved CS:IP points to the ESC instruction.

 <li> Coprocessor does not use interrupt controller.
 <br>
      The coprocessor error signal to the 80386 does not pass through an
      interrupt controller (an 8087 INT signal does). Some instructions in
      a coprocessor error handler may need to be deleted if they deal with
      the interrupt controller.

 <li> Six new interrupt vectors.
 <br>
      The 80386 adds six exceptions that arise only if the 8086 program has
      a hidden bug. It is recommended that exception handlers be added that
      treat these exceptions as invalid operations. This additional
      software does not significantly affect the existing 8086 software
      because the interrupts do not normally occur. These interrupt
      identifiers should not already have been used by the 8086 software,
      because they are in the range reserved by Intel. Table 14-2 describes
      the new 80386 exceptions.

 <li> One megabyte wraparound.
 <br>
      The 80386 does not wrap addresses at 1 megabyte in real-address mode.
      On members of the 8086 family, it possible to specify addresses
      greater than one megabyte.  For example, with a selector value 0FFFFH
      and an offset of 0FFFFH, the effective address would be 10FFEFH (1
      Mbyte + 65519).  The 8086, which can form adresses only up to 20 bits
      long, truncates the high-order bit, thereby "wrapping" this address
      to 0FFEFH.  However, the 80386, which can form addresses up to 32
      bits long does not truncate such an address.

    5       A BOUND instruction was executed with a register value outside
            the limit values.

    6       An undefined opcode was encountered or LOCK was used improperly
            before an instruction to which it does not apply.

    7       The EM bit in the MSW is set when an ESC instruction was
            encountered. This exception also occurs on a WAIT instruction
            if TS is set.

    8       An exception or interrupt has vectored to an interrupt table
            entry beyond the interrupt table limit in IDTR. This can occur
            only if the LIDT instruction has changed the limit from the
            default value of 3FFH, which is enough for all 256 interrupt
            IDs.

   12       Operand crosses extremes of stack segment, e.g., MOV operation
            at offset 0FFFFH or push with SP=1 during PUSH, CALL, or INT.

   13       Operand crosses extremes of a segment other than a stack
            segment; or sequential instruction execution attempts to
            proceed beyond offset 0FFFFH; or an instruction is longer than
            15 bytes (including prefixes).
