8.2  I/O Instructions
</h2>
<p>
The I/O instructions of the 80386 provide access to the processor's I/O
ports for the transfer of data to and from peripheral devices. These
instructions have as one operand the address of a port in the I/O address
space. There are two classes of I/O instruction:
<p>
<pre>
  1.  Those that transfer a single item (byte, word, or doubleword) located
      in a register.

  2.  Those that transfer strings of items (strings of bytes, words, or
      doublewords) located in memory. These are known as "string I/O
      instructions" or "block I/O instructions".

<h3>8.2.1  Register I/O Instructions</h3>
<p>
The I/O instructions IN and OUT are provided to move data between I/O ports
and the EAX (32-bit I/O), the AX (16-bit I/O), or AL (8-bit I/O) general
registers. IN and OUT instructions address I/O ports either directly, with
the address of one of up to 256 port addresses coded in the instruction, or
indirectly via the DX register to one of up to 64K port addresses.
<p>
IN (Input from Port) transfers a byte, word, or doubleword from an input
port to AL, AX, or EAX. If a program specifies AL with the IN instruction,
the processor transfers 8 bits from the selected port to AL. If a program
specifies AX with the IN instruction, the processor transfers 16 bits from
the port to AX. If a program specifies EAX with the IN instruction, the
processor transfers 32 bits from the port to EAX.
<p>
OUT (Output to Port) transfers a byte, word, or doubleword to an output
port from AL, AX, or EAX. The program can specify the number of the port
using the same methods as the IN instruction.

<h3>8.2.2  Block I/O Instructions</h3>
<p>
The block (or string) I/O instructions INS and OUTS move blocks of data
between I/O ports and memory space. Block I/O instructions use the DX
register to specify the address of a port in the I/O address space. INS and
OUTS use DX to specify:
<p>
<pre>
  -  8-bit ports numbered 0 through 65535
  -  16-bit ports numbered 0, 2, 4, . . . , 65532, 65534
  -  32-bit ports numbered 0, 4, 8, . . . , 65528, 65532
</pre>
Block I/O instructions use either SI or DI to designate the source or
destination memory address. For each transfer, SI or DI are automatically
either incremented or decremented as specified by the direction bit in the
flags register.
<p>
INS and OUTS, when used with repeat prefixes, cause block input or output
operations. REP, the repeat prefix, modifies INS and OUTS to provide a means
of transferring blocks of data between an I/O port and memory. These block
I/O instructions are string primitives (refer also to Chapter 3 for more on
string primitives). They simplify programming and increase the speed of data
transfer by eliminating the need to use a separate LOOP instruction or an
intermediate register to hold the data.
<p>
The string I/O primitives can operate on byte strings, word strings, or
doubleword strings. After each transfer, the memory address in ESI or EDI is
updated by 1 for byte operands, by 2 for word operands, or by 4 for
doubleword operands. The value in the direction flag (DF) determines whether
the processor automatically increments ESI or EDI (DF=0) or whether it
automatically decrements these registers (DF=1).
<p>
INS (Input String from Port) transfers a byte or a word string element from
an input port to memory. The mnemonics INSB, INSW, and INSD are variants
that explicitly specify the size of the operand. If a program specifies
INSB, the processor transfers 8 bits from the selected port to the memory
location indicated by ES:EDI. If a program specifies INSW, the processor
transfers 16 bits from the port to the memory location indicated by ES:EDI.
If a program specifies INSD, the processor transfers 32 bits from the port
to the memory location indicated by ES:EDI. The destination segment register
choice (ES) cannot be changed for the INS instruction. Combined with the REP
prefix, INS moves a block of information from an input port to a series of
consecutive memory locations.
<p>
OUTS (Output String to Port) transfers a byte, word, or doubleword string
element to an output port from memory. The mnemonics OUTSB, OUTSW, and OUTSD
are variants that explicitly specify the size of the operand. If a program
specifies OUTSB, the processor transfers 8 bits from the memory location
indicated by ES:EDI to the the selected port. If a program specifies OUTSW,
the processor transfers 16 bits from the memory location indicated by ES:EDI
to the the selected port. If a program specifies OUTSD, the processor
transfers 32 bits from the memory location indicated by ES:EDI to the the
selected port. Combined with the REP prefix, OUTS moves a block of
information from a series of consecutive memory locations indicated by
DS:ESI to an output port.
