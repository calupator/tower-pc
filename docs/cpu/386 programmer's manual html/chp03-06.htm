3.6  String and Character Translation Instructions
</h2>
<p>
The instructions in this category operate on strings rather than on logical
or numeric values. Refer also to the section on I/O for information about
the string I/O instructions (also known as block I/O).
<p>
The power of 80386 string operations derives from the following features of
the architecture:
<p>
1.  A set of primitive string operations
<p>
<pre>
   MOVS   -- Move String
   CMPS   -- Compare string
   SCAS   -- Scan string
   LODS   -- Load string
   STOS   -- Store string
</pre>
2.  Indirect, indexed addressing, with automatic incrementing or
<pre>
    decrementing of the indexes.

   Indexes:

      ESI    -- Source index register
      EDI    -- Destination index register

   Control flag:

      DF     -- Direction flag

   Control flag instructions:

      CLD    -- Clear direction flag instruction
      STD    -- Set direction flag instruction
</pre>
3.  Repeat prefixes
<p>
<pre>
   REP          -- Repeat while ECX not xero
   REPE/REPZ    -- Repeat while equal or zero
   REPNE/REPNZ  -- Repeat while not equal or not zero
</pre>
The primitive string operations operate on one element of a string. A
string element may be a byte, a word, or a doubleword. The string elements
are addressed by the registers ESI and EDI. After every primitive operation
ESI and/or EDI are automatically updated to point to the next element of the
string. If the direction flag is zero, the index registers are incremented;
if one, they are decremented. The amount of the increment or decrement is
1, 2, or 4 depending on the size of the string element.

<h3>3.6.1  Repeat Prefixes</h3>
<p>
The repeat prefixes REP (Repeat While ECX Not Zero), REPE/REPZ (Repeat
While Equal/Zero), and REPNE/REPNZ (Repeat While Not Equal/Not Zero) specify
repeated operation of a string primitive. This form of iteration allows the
CPU to process strings much faster than would be possible with a regular
software loop.
<p>
When a primitive string operation has a repeat prefix, the operation is
executed repeatedly, each time using a different element of the string. The
repetition terminates when one of the conditions specified by the prefix is
satisfied.
<p>
At each repetition of the primitive instruction, the string operation may
be suspended temporarily in order to handle an exception or external
interrupt. After the interruption, the string operation can be restarted
again where it left off. This method of handling strings allows operations
on strings of arbitrary length, without affecting interrupt response.
<p>
All three prefixes causes the hardware to automatically repeat the
associated string primitive until ECX=0. The differences among the repeat
prefixes have to do with the second termination condition. REPE/REPZ and
REPNE/REPNZ are used exclusively with the SCAS (Scan String) and CMPS
(Compare String) primitives. When these prefixes are used, repetition of the
next instruction depends on the zero flag (ZF) as well as the ECX register.
ZF does not require initialization before execution of a repeated string
instruction, because both SCAS and CMPS set ZF according to the results of
the comparisons they make. The differences are summarized in the
accompanying table.
<p>
<pre>
Prefix                      Termination         Termination
                            Condition 1         Condition 2

REP                           ECX = 0             (none)
REPE/REPZ                     ECX = 0             ZF = 0
REPNE/REPNZ                   ECX = 0             ZF = 1
</pre>

<h3>3.6.2  Indexing and Direction Flag Control</h3>
<p>
The addresses of the operands of string primitives are determined by the
ESI and EDI registers. ESI points to source operands. By default, ESI refers
to a location in the segment indicated by the DS segment register. A
segment-override prefix may be used, however, to cause ESI to refer to CS,
SS, ES, FS, or GS. EDI points to destination operands in the segment
indicated by ES; no segment override is possible. The use of two different
segment registers in one instruction allows movement of strings between
different segments.
<p>
This use of ESI and DSI has led to the descriptive names source index and
destination index for the ESI and EDI registers, respectively. In all
cases other than string instructions, however, the ESI and EDI registers may
be used as general-purpose registers.
<p>
When ESI and EDI are used in string primitives, they are automatically
incremented or decremented after to operation. The direction flag determines
whether they are incremented or decremented. The instruction CLD puts zero
in DF, causing the index registers to be incremented; the instruction STD
puts one in DF, causing the index registers to be decremented. Programmers
should always put a known value in DF before using string instructions in a
procedure.

<h3>3.6.3  String Instructions</h3>
<p>
MOVS (Move String) moves the string element pointed to by ESI to the
location pointed to by EDI. MOVSB operates on byte elements, MOVSW operates
on word elements, and MOVSD operates on doublewords. The destination segment
register cannot be overridden by a segment override prefix, but the source
segment register can be overridden.
<p>
The MOVS instruction, when accompanied by the REP prefix, operates as a
memory-to-memory block transfer. To set up for this operation, the program
must initialize ECX and the register pairs ESI and EDI. ECX specifies the
number of bytes, words, or doublewords in the block.
<p>
If DF=0, the program must point ESI to the first element of the source
string and point EDI to the destination address for the first element. If
DF=1, the program must point these two registers to the last element of the
source string and to the destination address for the last element,
respectively.
<p>
CMPS (Compare Strings) subtracts the destination string element (at ES:EDI)
from the source string element (at ESI) and updates the flags AF, SF, PF, CF
and OF. If the string elements are equal, ZF=1; otherwise, ZF=0. If DF=0,
the processor increments the memory pointers (ESI and EDI) for the two
strings. CMPSB compares bytes, CMPSW compares words, and CMPSD compares
doublewords. The segment register used for the source address can be changed
with a segment override prefix while the destination segment register
cannot be overridden.
<p>
SCAS (Scan String) subtracts the destination string element at ES:EDI from
EAX, AX, or AL and updates the flags AF, SF, ZF, PF, CF and OF. If the
values are equal, ZF=1; otherwise, ZF=0. If DF=0, the processor increments
the memory pointer (EDI) for the string. SCASB scans bytes; SCASW scans
words; SCASD scans doublewords. The destination segment register (ES) cannot
be overridden.
<p>
When either the REPE or REPNE prefix modifies either the SCAS or CMPS
primitives, the processor compares the value of the current string element
with the value in EAX for doubleword elements, in AX for word elements, or
in AL for byte elements. Termination of the repeated operation depends on
the resulting state of ZF as well as on the value in ECX.
<p>
LODS (Load String) places the source string element at ESI into EAX for
doubleword strings, into AX for word strings, or into AL for byte strings.
LODS increments or decrements ESI according to DF.
<p>
STOS (Store String) places the source string element from EAX, AX, or AL
into the string at ES:DSI. STOS increments or decrements EDI according to
DF.
