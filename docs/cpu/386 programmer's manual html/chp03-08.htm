3.8  Flag Control Instructions
</h2>
<p>
The flag control instructions provide a method for directly changing the
state of bits in the flag register.

<h3>3.8.1  Carry and Direction Flag Control Instructions</h3>
<p>
The carry flag instructions are useful in conjunction with
rotate-with-carry instructions RCL and RCR. They can initialize the carry
flag, CF, to a known state before execution of a rotate that moves the carry
bit into one end of the rotated operand.
<p>
The direction flag control instructions are specifically included to set or
clear the direction flag, DF, which controls the left-to-right or
right-to-left direction of string processing. If DF=0, the processor
automatically increments the string index registers, ESI and EDI, after each
execution of a string primitive. If DF=1, the processor decrements these
index registers. Programmers should use one of these instructions before any
procedure that uses string instructions to insure that DF is set properly.

<h3>3.8.2  Flag Transfer Instructions</h3>
<p>
Though specific instructions exist to alter CF and DF, there is no direct
method of altering the other applications-oriented flags. The flag transfer
instructions allow a program to alter the other flag bits with the bit
manipulation instructions after transferring these flags to the stack or the
AH register.
<p>
The instructions LAHF and SAHF deal with five of the status flags, which
are used primarily by the arithmetic and logical instructions.
<p>
LAHF (Load AH from Flags) copies SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF to AH bits 7, 6, 4,
2, and 0, respectively (see Figure 3-22). The contents of the remaining bits
(5, 3, and 1) are undefined. The flags remain unaffected.
<p>
SAHF (Store AH into Flags) transfers bits 7, 6, 4, 2, and 0 from AH into
SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF, respectively (see Figure 3-22).
<p>
The PUSHF and POPF instructions are not only useful for storing the flags
in memory where they can be examined and modified but are also useful for
preserving the state of the flags register while executing a procedure.
<p>
PUSHF (Push Flags) decrements ESP by two and then transfers the low-order
word of the flags register to the word at the top of stack pointed to by ESP
(see Figure 3-23). The variant PUSHFD decrements ESP by four, then
transfers both words of the extended flags register to the top of the stack
pointed to by ESP (the VM and RF flags are not moved, however).
<p>
POPF (Pop Flags) transfers specific bits from the word at the top of stack
into the low-order byte of the flag register (see Figure 3-23), then
increments ESP by two. The variant POPFD transfers specific bits from the
doubleword at the top of the stack into the extended flags register (the RF
and VM flags are not changed, however), then increments ESP by four.

                   +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

     LAHF LOADS FIVE FLAGS FROM THE FLAG REGISTER INTO REGISTER AH. SAHF
     STORES THESE SAME FIVE FLAGS FROM AH INTO THE FLAG REGISTER. THE BIT
     POSITION OF EACH FLAG IS THE SAME IN AH AS IT IS IN THE FLAG REGISTER.
     THE REMAINING BITS (MARKED UU) ARE RESERVED; DO NOT DEFINE.
