6.2  Overview of 80386 Protection Mechanisms
</h2>
<p>
Protection in the 80386 has five aspects:
<p>
<pre>
  1.  Type checking
  2.  Limit checking
  3.  Restriction of addressable domain
  4.  Restriction of procedure entry points
  5.  Restriction of instruction set
</pre>
The protection hardware of the 80386 is an integral part of the memory
management hardware. Protection applies both to segment translation and to
page translation.
<p>
Each reference to memory is checked by the hardware to verify that it
satisfies the protection criteria. All these checks are made before the
memory cycle is started; any violation prevents that cycle from starting and
results in an exception. Since the checks are performed concurrently with
address formation, there is no performance penalty.
<p>
Invalid attempts to access memory result in an exception. Refer to
Chapter 9 for an explanation of the exception mechanism. The present
chapter defines the protection violations that lead to exceptions.
<p>
The concept of "privilege" is central to several aspects of protection
(numbers 3, 4, and 5 in the preceeding list). Applied to procedures,
privilege is the degree to which the procedure can be trusted not to make a
mistake that might affect other procedures or data. Applied to data,
privilege is the degree of protection that a data structure should have
from less trusted procedures.
<p>
The concept of privilege applies both to segment protection and to page
protection.
