<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><A HREF="../Sep96/Sep96.html">In September</A>,
I presented the basics for determining the identification of specific families
of x86 processors - the 8086/88, 80186/88, 80286, 80386, 80486, Pentium,
Pentium Pro, and the like. In doing so, I analyzed the processor-detection
algorithm distributed by Intel, noting that it failed to detect some processor
families, contained a bug that caused it to misdiagnose some processors,
depended on undocumented processor behavior, and wasn't guaranteed to work
outside of real mode.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In spite of these shortcomings, the Intel algorithm
remains in widespread use primarily because it's supported by Intel, and
it works most of the time. I concluded by mentioning the possibility of
writing an algorithm that was more reliable, detected more processor types,
didn't rely on undocumented processor behavior, and returned the actual
processor-stepping information - even on processors that don't support
the CPUID instruction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Much like Intel's, my technique uses an algorithm
to detect different processor families that haven't employed the CPUID
instruction. My algorithm executes a series of instructions that do not
exist on all processor families. The algorithm detects if a processor supports
a particular instruction, thereby detecting the processor family. For example,
Intel implemented at least one new instruction with each successive processor
family. My algorithm detects processor differences by attempting to execute
these newly implemented instructions. If the instruction doesn't exist,
an invalid-opcode exception is generated. My algorithm intercepts this
exception and reports that an invalid opcode was detected. Once a newly
implemented opcode executes successfully, the processor family has been
determined. This will not work on the 8086/88 however, as this microprocessor
did not employ the invalid-opcode exception type.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The 8086-family and 80186- family processors must
be detected in a different manner. The <I><U>iAPX286Programmer's Reference
Manual, Appendix D</U> </I>(Intel, part #210498) provides critical information
that benefits this algorithm:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;The iAPX 286 will push a different value
on the stack for PUSH SP than the iAPX 86/88.&quot;</FONT></I></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The 8086/88 and 80186/188 had a bug in the PUSH
SP microcode. The 8086 and 80186 stored the value of SP on the stack after
it was decremented, instead of decrementing SP first and storing the resultant
value on the stack. Any program that executed PUSH SP and a subsequent
POP SP would not receive the same value for the PUSH/POP combination. Therefore,
this well-documented difference is exploited to detect the difference in
these families of processors. Examples 1(a) and 1(b) illustrate use of
the PUSH SP microcoded algorithm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While the 80186 also demonstrates this same PUSH
SP behavior, it also implements the invalid-opcode exception type. Therefore,
it is possible to install an invalid-opcode exception handler and execute
an instruction that exists only on the 80186-family processors. This would
determine whether an 80186-family processor was installed. However, I couldn't
use this approach. I needed to differentiate the 8086 from 80186, and therefore
couldn't use the invalid-opcode exception for this purpose, as it does
not exist on the 8086. Instead, I relied upon another documented difference
between the 8086 and 80186. This difference is mentioned in the <I><U>80186/188,
80C186/C188 Hardware Reference Manual</U> </I>(#270788), page A-2:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;When a word write is performed at offset
FFFFh in a segment, the 8086 will write one byte at offset FFFFh, and the
other at offset 0, while an 80186 family processor will write one byte
at offset FFFFh, and the other at offset 10000h (one byte beyond the end
of the segment).&quot;</FONT></I></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">All processors from the 80286 to 80486 are detected
by installing an invalid-opcode exception handler and executing instructions
unique to each processor. When an instruction executes (doesn't generate
an exception), the processor family has been determined.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Any processor family that implements the CPUID
instruction does not need to use this technique. This would include all
Pentium-class processors, late-model 486s, and some non-Intel x86-compatible
processors. Once a 386- or 486-class processor has been detected, my algorithm
blindly executes a CPUID instruction. I don't make any attempt to verify
the existence of the CPUID instruction using the Intel recommended approach
(attempt to toggle EFLAGS.ID). I do this because</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">I already have an invalid-opcode handler installed,
therefore no harm can occur from executing the CPUID instruction.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Nexgen Nx586 implements the CPUID instruction,
but not the EFLAGS.ID bit. In this case, the Intel algorithm used to detect
the EFLAGS.ID bit would fail.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Cyrix 6x86 implements both EFLAGS.ID and
CPUID, but must be enabled by programming a processor-configuration register.
It would be inappropriate for a CPU-identification algorithm to make any
assumptions about the configurability of an unknown processor type and
hence, program some model-specific registers.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The remainder of the algorithm depends on the
success or failure of the CPUID instruction. If CPUID exists, it is used
to determine whether or not the processor is a genuine Intel processor.
If it is, the processor-detection algorithm is completed; if not, the results
are modified with a flag to indicate a non-Intel processor (see the comments
in <A HREF="../../ftp/source/cpuid/cpuid.asm">CPUID.ASM</A>, available
electronically; see &quot;<A HREF="#Avail">Availability</A>,&quot; below).
If the CPUID instruction doesn't exist, an invalid-opcode exception occurs,
and the processor model and stepping are determined by other means.</FONT></P>

<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Detecting the Processor Model</FONT></FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Detecting the processor model on processors without
the CPUID instruction is considerably more difficult. For example, the
80386, 80486, and Pentium have many model types. The 80386 family consists
of models DX, SX, CX, EX, and SL. The 80486 family consists of models DX,
DX2, DX4, SX, SX2, and SL, along with the 80487 DX and SX. The Pentium
family is still growing, but currently has the P5, P54C, OverDrive, and
OverDrive for DX4 processors. Sometimes it is possible to detect these
different models, and other times it isn't. (The Intel algorithm makes
no attempt at determining any processor models.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The 80386 DX and SX may be differentiated from
each other by detecting differences in the CRO register. Bit 4 of this
register (CR0.ET) may be toggled on the 80386 DX, while it is hardwired
to 1 on the 80386 SX, CX, EX, and SL. This difference is found by comparing
Figure 2.2 of the 386 SX microprocessor data sheet (#240187) to the other
386-class processor data sheets. A further distinction may be made to detect
the 80386 SL, which has the ability to return its processor identification
by executing a series of I/O operations (IN/OUT instructions). Accessing
this internal register is documented in the 80386 SL data sheet (#240815),
section 8.2. In this case, the actual family, model, and stepping information
is returned.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In theory, the 80486 DX and SX may be detected
in the same manner as the 80386 DX and SX. This difference is documented
in Figure 2.5 of the <I><U>486 Microprocessor, 487 Math Coprocessor</U>
</I>data sheet #240950). However, in reality, the documentation is wrong,
as CR0.ET is hardwired to 1, regardless of which 80486 is in use. Therefore,
no distinction is made between the 80486 DX and the 80487 SX. However,
the 80486 DX and 80486 SX may be distinguished from each other by detecting
the presence of the floating-point unit (FPU). This algorithm is documented
in the <I><U>80286 and 80287 Programmer's Reference Manual</U> </I>(80287
section of the manual), Figure 3-1 (#210498). The 80486 SL processor may
be detected in the exact same manner as the 80386 SL. I did not attempt
to write an algorithm to detect the differences between the 80486 DX2 and
DX4. Therefore this algorithm makes no attempt to differentiate these models.</FONT></P>

<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Detecting the Processor Stepping
Information</FONT></FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A deeper level of processor identification includes
obtaining the actual stepping information of the processor. The stepping
information is useful in determining which bugs are fixed in a specific
model. Even with this information, you must cross reference the stepping
ID with the errata documents to determine which bugs are fixed. This information
is publicly available for the Pentium and Pentium Pro. For all other processors,
it is still kept confidential and released only by nondisclosure agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The stepping information is contained in an internal
processor register called the &quot;ID register.&quot; On all 80386s and
later processors, this information is returned in EDX after the processor
completes a RESET. This information is not provided on any processor family
before the 80386. Even though the format of this register has changed slightly
over time, it contains the same essential information. To obtain this ID
register on processors that do not support the CPUID instruction, you must
RESET the processor. All PC compatibles have a means to recover from a
RESET and return control to a user program. To do this, you must store
a special signature in CMOS RAM, and a far-jump pointer in memory before
the RESET occurs. After RESET, the BIOS reads this signature and returns
control to your program at the specified far-jump pointer. This doesn't
always work to retrieve the processor ID, as there is no guarantee that
EDX hasn't been destroyed by the time the user program regains control.
There is another technique, but it is much more complicated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">To capture the processor ID, you must take control
of code execution immediately after a RESET occurs. Whenever the processor
is RESET, the CPU starts execution from physical address 0xFFFFFFF0. The
chipset maps the BIOS from 0xF0000 to the top of memory at 0xFFFF0000.
This allows the CPU to start executing BIOS code immediately after RESET.
We want to prevent the BIOS from gaining control of execution after RESET
and, instead, direct control to our own program. In theory, this is impossible,
but due to the design of the PC, there is a way to gain control of execution
before the BIOS. Imagine what would happen if the first instructions the
processor fetched from the RESET vector contained a bunch of invalid opcodes.
The processor would generate an invalid-opcode exception and dispatch the
invalid-opcode exception handler. The invalid-opcode exception handler
is dispatched by reading a far pointer from address 0:Ox18 and branching
to that location whenever such an exception occurs. If you set up an invalid-opcode
exception handler before a RESET occurs, and somehow prevent the BIOS from
taking control of execution upon RESET, the exception handler could save
the contents of the CPUID (contained in EDX) before returning control to
your CPUID-detection program. The difficulty in this technique is forcing
an invalid-opcode exception to occur after RESET, upon the first instructions
fetched. Normally, this would not occur, as the first instructions fetched
would always be valid BIOS instructions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Forcing the CPU to fetch invalid opcodes upon
RESET is easier than it might sound. This technique doesn't employ anything
as esoteric as reprogramming the chipset to unmask the BIOS Shadow RAM,
then modifying the executable RAM image of the BIOS to contain invalid
opcodes, then resetting the processor. Surely this would work to generate
an invalid-opcode exception, but this technique would be specific to each
chipset implementation and is a ludicrous suggestion. There is a much simpler
solution. Remember that the CPU starts executing at physical address 0xFFFFFFF0
upon RESET. If you could force the CPU to execute from a different physical-memory
address or somehow make a different physical-memory address appear at 0xFFFFFFF0,
this would likely suffice to cause the CPU to fetch invalid opcodes and
generate the requisite exception. Unfortunately, there is no way to force
the CPU to fetch from any address other than 0xFFFFFFF0, so you must think
of a technique to force some other memory location to appear at that address.
In this case, you can thank the CPU A20 gate, which is required by every
PC-compatible computer. (I will not explain the CPU A20 gate, or the significance
of the CPU address line A20 for PC-compatibility. For further information
on this subject, see http://www.x86.org/articles/A20.) When the A20 gate
is programmed for 8086 compatibility, the CPU address line A20 is always
grounded. This has the side-effect of making physical address 0xFFEFFFF0
map to 0xFFFFFFF0. If a reset occurs when the A20 gate is programmed in
this mode, the CPU fetches opcodes from address 0xFFEFFFF0 instead of the
normal location (though the CPU doesn't know the difference). Most likely,
there aren't any valid instructions at this address, and the processor
fetches invalid opcodes. Subsequently, the requisite invalid-opcode exception
occurs. Thus, our invalid- opcode exception handler seizes control of execution
and stores the CPUID value from EDX for later use by your program. The
program <A HREF="ftp://ftp.x86.org/source/cpuid/shutdown.asm">SHUTDOWN.ASM</A>
demonstrates this technique.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">There are times when this technique doesn't work.
Some chipsets think of this anomaly as a bug that could lead to a system
hang. Such chipsets map the BIOS to both locations (0xFFEF0000 and 0xFFFF0000).
Therefore, regardless of the state of the A20 gate, a system RESET will
gracefully invoke the BIOS reset code instead of allowing the system to
hang. When a chipset decodes the BIOS in both regions, this technique will
not work. Therefore, my source code detects this condition and doesn't
attempt to use this technique if it's not going to work.</FONT></P>

<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+2>The Caveats</FONT></FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This algorithm is written for real and v86 mode.
However, the algorithm (not the actual implementation) can easily be adapted
to CPL-0 protected mode.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Executing this algorithm while using some memory
managers may not work. Older memory managers, like Microsoft's EMM386.EXE,
will not allow an application program to execute its own invalid-opcode
exception handler. Such memory managers halt the system when such an exception
occurs. Such behavior by the memory manager should be considered a design
flaw on their part, and not consistent with Intel's original intent of
providing the invalid- opcode exception type. The invalid-opcode exception
was intended to trap invalid opcodes and allow extensions to the x86 architecture.
It was envisioned that a software developer could define his own opcodes
and rely on his own invalid-opcode exception handler to implement instruction
extensions. This intention was documented by Intel in the <I><U>iAPX 286
Programmer's Reference Manual</U>, Appendix B:</I></FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;Since the offending opcode will always
be invalid, it cannot be restarted. However, the #UD handler might be coded
to implement an extension of the iAPX 286 instruction set. In that case,
the handler could advance the return pointer beyond the extended instruction
and return control to the program after the extended instruction is emulated.
Any such extensions may be incompatible with the iAPX 386.&quot;</FONT></I></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Further supporting my point is the fact that Intel
has reserved two opcodes specifically for this purpose. These opcodes will
not be used by Intel and are guaranteed to be reserved on future generations
of processors. These opcodes are documented in the 1995 edition of the
<I><A HREF="http://www.intel.com/design/pentium/manuals/241430_4.pdf">Pentium
Processor Family Developer's Manual, Volume 3</A> </I>(#241430), Appendix
A:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;<I>0F0B and 0FB9 should be used when deliberately
generating an invalid-opcode exception.</I>&quot;</FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">All currently available memory managers pass the
invalid-opcode exception to the faulting v86 task. This development relegates
all of the objections lodged against my algorithm into obsolescence. I
tested EMM386-95, 386Max v8.0, and QEMM v8.0, and found that my algorithm
works without any problems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I only make a half-hearted attempt to identify
non-Intel processors. Some non-Intel processors are identified as a byproduct
of my algorithm. To accommodate non-Intel processors, I have used two bits
of the result code to indicate their detection (bits 15 and 14). The <I><A HREF="ftp://ftp.intel.com/pub/IAL/software_specs/ap48504f.pdf">Intel
Processor Identification With the CPUID Instruction</A></I> (#241618) lists
these two bits as reserved. Should Intel change their specification, my
algorithm would need modification.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I make no attempt at determining some processor
model types. In some cases, it may be possible to take advantage of processor
differences (such as the number of CPU address lines) to detect model differences.
However, any such technique would be at the mercy of the chipset implementation
(which can map unused memory to the system bus), and render the technique
ineffective.</FONT></P>

<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+2>The Results</FONT></FONT></H2>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I tested each processor in as many environments
as I had available. In all cases, I booted from a Windows 95 boot floppy
(except the 80286, which isn't supported by Windows 95). I tested the algorithm
without any device drivers loaded (Clean), and using the latest versions
of EMM386, 386Max, and QEMM. I also downloaded <A HREF="http://webusers.anet-dfw.com/~jimb/v86mon.zip">V86MON</A>
from Jim Brooks' Web site (<A HREF="http://webusers.anet-dfw.com/~jimb/x86.htm">http://webusers.anet-dfw.com/~jimb/x86.htm</A>).
V86MON is a virtual-mode manager that is ideal for testing how a real-mode
application will operate in v86 mode. The author claims to have run hundreds
of real-mode applications without a single error by providing near-perfect
real-mode emulation. V86MON has four flavors: v86 mode with and without
interrupt virtualization, and enhanced v86 mode with and without interrupt
virtualization. <A HREF="#Tbl1">Table 1</A> summarizes the results.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Occasionally, the Intel algorithm fails to properly
detect any processor higher than an 80386, instead identifying an 80486,
Pentium, and Pentium Pro as an 80386. (I described this bug in my September
column.) This error manifests itself when I boot without any device drivers
(Clean) and while using all of the V86MON variants. As I found out, the
near-perfect real-mode emulation of V86MON was a little too perfect, as
Intel's algorithm demonstrated the same errant behavior when run under
V86MON. The bug didn't manifest itself when run under EMM386, 386Max, or
QEMM. In these cases, the bug was obscured because these memory managers
didn't perfectly emulate real-mode behavior. Regardless, my algorithm isn't
prone to this failure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Intel's algorithm locked up the computer when
run on V86MON (normal v86 mode) with interrupt virtualization enabled.
My algorithm ran perfectly in this environment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Intel's algorithm detects the AMD 5k86 as an 80486-class
processor, even though it has all of the features and instructions of the
Pentium, including the CPUID instruction. My algorithm correctly detects
this processor as a non-Intel, Pentium-class processor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Intel's algorithm detected the Cyrix 6x86 as an
80486-class processor, even though it has all of the performance and instructions
of a Pentium-class processor. In real mode, my algorithm used the processor-shutdown
technique to correctly detect the 6x86 as a non-Intel, Pentium class processor.
Outside of real mode, my algorithm also detected the 6x86 as an 80486-class
processor. Intel's algorithm detected the Nexgen Nx586 as an 80386-class
processor. My algorithm detected the Nx586 using CPUID, and correctly reported
it as a non-Intel, Pentium-class processor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Overall, both algorithms produce similar results
and operate properly in a wide range of environments. Back when the CPUID
algorithm wars were raging (circa 1988, 1989), the pundits lauded the Intel
algorithm over my approach, claiming that their algorithm worked in a wider
range of operating environments. I argued the technical correctness of
my algorithm and claimed the memory managers, which kept my algorithm from
running, were designed incorrectly. Therefore, I was proud to discover
that all of the memory managers I tested for this column have fixed their
designs. This allows my algorithm to run without failure. As my results
demonstrate, my algorithm works in a wider range of operating environments,
isn't prone to misdiagnosing the processor family, isn't prone to misdiagnosing
non-Intel processors, provides the processor model type where applicable,
and provides the model and stepping information on processors that don't
support the CPUID instruction. In addition to these benefits, my algorithm
is adaptable to protected mode, whereas Intel's isn't. This should settle
the CPUID algorithm wars once and for all, or at least for the next delta
of time.</FONT></P>
