I needed a way to browse thru all of these fonts and figured that you would 
too; so I wrote browse.bat and display.bat.  

To use browse.bat, just run it with the filespec of the font files you'd like 
to see.  For example, if you want to see what the Old English fonts look like 
type this: 

browse old*.*

Yossi Gil's utilities do almost all of the work but they don't quite do all 
that is necessary.  Browse.bat cycles thru all of the files you specify with 
the argument by using a FOR statement and display.bat clears the screen, 
displays all of the font's characters, displays the font's name and waits for 
you to press a key.  Display.bat is just serves as a container for all of 
these commands since a FOR statement can only take one command in its DO 
clause. 

Have fun with these and don't forget to get my program, BIGTXT20, so you can 
make banners with your favorite font!  Look for BIGTXT20 in the screen 
directory of your local Simtel archive mirror.
