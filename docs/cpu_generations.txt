new in 186:
- pusha/popa
- push immed
- ins/outs
- enter/leave/bound
- multiply immed (just imul?)
- shift/rotate by immed

new in 386:
- lss, lfs, lgs
- long-displacement jcc's
- single-bit instructions
- bit scan
- double-shift instructions
- byte set on condition
- movsx/movzx
- generalized multiply
- mov to/from cr's tr's and dr's

differences between 8086 and 386:
- divide exceptions: 8086 - cs:ip = next instr ::: 386 - cs:ip = offending instr
- push sp: 8086 - pushes incremented sp ::: 386 - pushes original sp
- masking shifts and rotates: 8086 doesn't mask, 386 masks to 31 bits
- 8086 - no instruction length limit ::: 386 - exception 13 on instructions longer than 15 bytes :::
- 8086 - can cross offset of 0xffff ::: 386 - raises exception 12 for ss' access and exception 13 for other segs
- 8086 - cs:ip can execute across 0xffff boundary ::: 386 - exception 13 raised
- something about lock prefix?
- 8086 - IDIV of quotient 0x80/0x8000 = exception 0 ::: 386 - IDIV of quotient 0x80/0x8000 successful
- 8086 - flags[12..15] = 1 ::: 386 - flags[15] = 0, flags[12..14] = value loaded into it
- 386 - upon NMI, NMI interrupt is masked until IRET
- 386 - cs:ip on coprocessor exception = points to prefix. ::: 8086 - cs:ip on coproc excep points to ESC byte
- new exceptions: 5-8,12,13
