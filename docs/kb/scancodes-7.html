<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Three scancode sets</A>
</H2>

<P>The usual PC keyboards are capable of producing three sets of scancodes.
Writing 0xf0 followed by 1, 2 or 3 to port 0x60 will put the keyboard
in scancode mode 1, 2 or 3. Writing 0xf0 followed by 0 queries the mode,
resulting in a scancode byte 0x43, 0x41 or 0x3f from the keyboard.
<P>Set 1 contains the values that the XT keyboard (with only one set
of scancodes) produced, with extensions for new keys. Someone
decided that another numbering was more logical and invented
scancode Set 2. However, it was realized that new scancodes
would break old programs, so the keyboard output was fed to a
8042 microprocessor on the motherboard that could translate Set 2
back into Set 1. Indeed a smart construction. This is the default today.
Finally there is the PS/2 version, Set 3, more regular, but used by
almost nobody.
<P>(I wrote this long ago. Nowadays Linux 2.5 tries to use Set 3.
Also certain HP machines, like the PS/2 version of the HP9000
workstation, have used Set 3.)
<P>Sets 2 and 3 are designed to be translated by the 8042.
Set 1 should not be translated.
<P>Not all keyboards support all scancode sets. For example, my MyCom
laptop only supports scancode Set 2, and its keyboard does not react
at all when in mode 1 or 3.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Make and Break codes</A>
</H2>

<P>The key press / key release is coded as follows:
For Set 1, if the make code of a key is <I>c</I>, the break code
will be <I>c</I>+0x80. If the make code is <B>e0</B> <I>c</I>,
the break code will be <B>e0</B> <I>c</I>+0x80.
The Pause key has make code <B>e1</B> <B>1d</B> <B>45</B>
<B>e1</B> <B>9d</B> <B>c5</B> and does not generate a break code.
For Set 2, if the make code of a key is <I>c</I>, the break code
will be <B>f0</B> <I>c</I>. If the make code is <B>e0</B> <I>c</I>,
the break code will be <B>e0</B> <B>f0</B> <I>c</I>.
The Pause key has make code <B>e1</B> <B>14</B> <B>77</B>
<B>e1</B> <B>f0</B> <B>14</B> <B>f0</B> <B>77</B>.
For Set 3, by default most keys do not generate a break code - only CapsLock,
LShift, RShift, LCtrl and LAlt do.
(On Microsoft keyboards, also LWin, RWin, Menu, Back, Forward, Stop,
Mail, Search, Favorites, Web/Home, MyComputer, Calculator, Sleep do.
On a BTC keyboard, also the Macro key does.)
However, in Scancode Mode 3 it is possible to enable or disable key repeat
and the production of break codes either on a key-by-key basis
or for all keys at once.
And just like for Set 2, key release is indicated by a <B>f0</B> prefix
in those cases where it is indicated.
There is nothing special with the Pause key in scancode mode 3.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Translation</A>
</H2>

<P>The 8042 microprocessor translates the incoming byte stream produced
by the keyboard, and turns an <B>f0</B> prefix into an OR with
<B>80</B> for the next byte.
<A NAME="contagious"></A> 
(Some implementations do this for the next byte that does not have
this bit set already. A consequence is that in Set 3 the keys with Set-3
value 0x80 or more are broken in a peculiar way: hitting such a key and
then some other key turns the make code for this last key into a break code.
For example the Sleep key on a Microsoft Internet keyboard generates
<B>54</B> / <B>d4</B> for press/release. But pressing and
releasing first Menu and then Sleep produces
<B>8d</B> <B>8d</B> <B>d4</B> <B>d4</B> as translation of
<B>8d</B> <B>f0</B> <B>8d</B> <B>54</B> <B>f0</B> <B>54</B>.
Other implementations are OK.)
<P>
<A NAME="translationtable"></A> 
Unless told not to translate, the keyboard controller translates
kscancodes into scancodes using the following table (in hex):

<P>A reference for the first half of this table is the book by Gary J Konzak
<I>PC 8042 Controller</I>, ISBN 0-929392-21-3.
(Report by <CODE>vojtech@suse.cz</CODE>.)
<P>A way to check this table is: (i) put the keyboard in untranslated modes
1, 2, 3 and look at the 
<A HREF="table.h">resulting values</A>,
and (ii) put the keyboard in translated scancode modes 1, 2, 3. Now compare
the values. The entries with question marks were not checked in this way.
<P>Note that the range <B>01</B>-<B>7f</B> of this table is 1-1.
In the second half of the table, translated and untranslated values
are equal in all known cases, with the two exceptions <B>83</B> and <B>84</B>.
<P>One asks the controller to transmit untranslated scancodes by writing
a keyboard controller command with bit 5 set and bit 6 cleared.
E.g., use the command byte <B>45</B> to get translated codes,
and <B>24</B> to get untranslated codes that do not cause interrupts.
<P>
<H3>Effects of translation</H3>

<P>
<H3>Origin of strange scan code set values</H3>

<P>The keyboard command <B>f0</B> with argument 1, 2 or 3
sets the current scancode set, and this same command
with argument 0 asks for the current scancode set.
The reply is <B>43</B>, <B>41</B> or <B>3f</B>
for sets 1, 2, 3. Why? Because in reality the reply is 1, 2 or 3,
and that is what one sees when translation is off. But translation
turns these into <B>43</B>, <B>41</B>, <B>3f</B>.
<P>
<H3>Keyboard IDs</H3>

<P>Keyboards do report an ID as a reply to the command <B>f2</B>.
(An XT keyboard does not reply, an AT keyboard only replies with an ACK.)
An MF2 AT keyboard reports ID <B>ab</B> <B>83</B>.
Translation turns this into <B>ab</B> <B>41</B>.
<P>Many short keyboards, like IBM ThinkPads, and Spacesaver keyboards,
send <B>ab</B> <B>84</B> untranslated,
which becomes <B>ab</B> <B>54</B> translated.
(The netbsd source has a misunderstanding here, and seems to associate
the <B>54</B> and <B>84</B> to the ThinkPad model - cf. the defines
KEYB_R_MF2ID2TP75X, KEYB_R_MF2ID2TP76X.)
<P>Several 122-key keyboards are reported to send <B>ab</B> <B>86</B>.
Here translated and untranslated values coincide.
(Reports mention "122-Key Enhanced Keyboard", "standard 122-key keyboard",
"122 Key Mainframe Interactive (MFI) Keyboard".)
<P>Tim Clarke reports <B>ab</B> <B>85</B> for the
"122-Key Host Connect(ed) Keyboard".
<P>He also reports
<I>Also, when playing with my KVM problems Belkin gave me a
105-key Windows keyboard which Id.s itself as 18ABh</I>.
<P>Linux 2.5.25 kernel source has 0xaca1 for a
"NCD Sun layout keyboard". It also mentions 0xab02 and 0xab7f,
but these arise as (mistaken) back translations from
<B>ab</B> <B>41</B> and <B>ab</B> <B>54</B>.
<P>Ralph Brown's Interrupt list mentions "old Japanese 'G', 'P', 'A' keyboards",
with keyboard IDs <B>ab</B> <B>90</B>, <B>ab</B> <B>91</B>,
<B>ab</B> <B>92</B>. Here translated and untranslated versions
coincide.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Use</A>
</H2>

<P>Can these other scancode sets be used? Probably not.
<P>() Translated scancode Set 1 has weird codes that nobody wants to use.
<P>(i) My MyCom laptop does not support scancode sets 1 and 3 at all.
<P>(ii) Some laptops have special key combinations that bring one
into a setup or configuration utility. It is impossible to do
anything useful, or to get out of it again, when the scancode mode
is not translated Set 2.
<P>(iii) Many keyboards have bugs in scancode sets 1 and/or 3 but
are fine in scancode Set 2.
Vojtech Pavlik reports that his BTC keyboard has the same codes
for the '1' and '2' keys in Set3, both having the code for '1').
On my BTC keyboard the key up value for Esc and 1 are both <B>ff</B>
in scancode Set 1. My Safeway keyboard has untranslated Set 1 equal
to translated Set 2, except for the multimedia keys, where
untranslated Set 1 equals untranslated Set 2.
<P>(iv) A big advantage of Set 3 is that each key generates a unique code
so that one does not need to parse sequences. However, the BTC keyboard
mentioned 
<A HREF="scancodes-5.html#BTC">above</A> generates <B>e0</B> <B>6f</B>
for its Macro key also in scancode mode 3. The Safeway keyboard mentioned
<A HREF="scancodes-5.html#safeway23">above</A> does not generate any codes
for its multimedia keys in scancode mode 3.
<P>(v) Some keyboard controllers cannot handle Set 3 values that are
larger than 0x7f, and give 
<A HREF="#contagious">peculiar results</A>
for some keys on the Microsoft Internet keyboard in translated
scancode mode 3.
<P>(vi) The USB legacy support only supports translated Set 2.
<P>(vii) The 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/download/desinit/scancode.zip">Microsoft Keyboard Scan Code Specification</A> writes:
<I>In the very early days of Windows NT, an attempt was made
to use the much more orthogonal Scan Code Set 3, but due to bugs
in the implementation of this Scan Code Set on numerous OEM
keyboards, the idea was abandoned.</I>
And also: <I>Scan Code Set 3 is not used or required for operation
of Microsoft operating systems.</I>
<P>(viii) Others also tried Set 3. The PS/2 version of the HP9000
workstation uses it. This is fine with HP's keyboards but causes
some problems with foreign keyboards.
<P>(ix) It is said that Hal Snyder of Mark Williams, Co remarked:
"We find that about 10% of cheap no-name keyboards do not work
in scan code set 3".
<P>(x) These days Linux tries to enable Set 3.
This is good for learning a lot about strange keyboards.
It is bad for having a stable system that just works.
