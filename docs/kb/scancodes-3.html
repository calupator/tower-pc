<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Special keyboards - Amstrad/Schneider keyboards</A></H2>

<P><I>Since IBM had patented their keyboard design,
Amstrad developed an entirely different keyboard.</I>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Amstrad/Schneider PC1512</A>
</H2>

<P>The 
<A HREF="amstrad.jpg">Amstrad keyboard</A>
is entirely incompatible with XT and AT keyboards, and can be used only
on an Amstrad; conversely, no other keyboard will work on an older Amstrad.
This keyboard has a Del key on the keypad, and both Del-> and Del&lt;- keys
above the Enter key. The Del-> key has scancode <B>70</B>.
Left of the Enter key a PrtSc/* key.
There is an additional Enter key with scancode <B>74</B>.
It is possible to connect a mouse and/or joystick to the keyboard,
and then these devices also yield scancodes:
<B>77</B> (joystick button 1), <B>78</B> (joystick button 2),
<B>79</B> (joystick right), <B>7a</B> (joystick left),
<B>7b</B> (joystick up), <B>7c</B> (joystick down),
<B>7d</B> (mouse right), <B>7e</B> (mouse left).
