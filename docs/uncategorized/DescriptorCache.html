<H1><A NAME="desc_anomalies"></A>DESCRIPTOR CACHE REGISTERS</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>Whether in real or protected mode, the CPU stores the base address of
each segment in hidden registers called descriptor cache registers. Each
time a segment register is loaded, the segment base address, segment size
limit, and access attributes (access rights) are loaded, or &quot;cached,&quot;
into these hidden registers. To enhance performance, all subsequent memory
references are made via the descriptor cache registers instead of calculating
the physical address, or looking up the base address in the descriptor
table. Understanding the role of these hidden registers is paramount for
exploiting highly advanced programming techniques, and for exploiting the
undocumented instruction LOADALL. <A HREF="../articles/loadall/tspec_a3_f2.html#fig2a">Figure
2a</A> shows the descriptor cache layout for the 80286, and <A HREF="../articles/loadall/tspec_a3_f2.html#fig2b">figure
2b</A> shows the layout for the 80386, and 80486.</P>

<P>At power-up, the descriptor cache registers are loaded with fixed, default
values; the CPU is in real-mode, and all segments are marked as read/write
data segments, including the Code Segment (CS). According to Intel, each
time any segment register is loaded in real-mode, the base address is 16x
the segment value, while the access rights and size limit attributes are
given fixed, &quot;real-mode compatible&quot; values. This is not true.
In fact, only the CS descriptor cache gets loaded with fixed values each
time the segment register is loaded. Loading any other segment register
in real mode doesn't change the access rights or the segment size limit
attributes stored in the descriptor cache registers. For these segments,
the access rights and segment size limit attributes are &quot;honored&quot;
from any previous setting (see <A HREF="../articles/loadall/tspec_a3_f3.html">figure
3</A>). Thus it is possible to have a 4G-byte Read-Only data segment in
real-mode on the 80386, but Intel won't acknowledge, or support this mode
of operation.</P>

<P>Protected mode differs from real mode in this respect: as each time
a segment register is loaded, the descriptor cache register gets fully
loaded; no values are &quot;honored.&quot; The descriptor cache is loaded
directly from the descriptor table. The CPU checks the validity of the
segment by testing the access rights in the descriptor table. Complete
checks are made, and illegal values will generate exceptions. Any attempt
to load CS with a read/write data segment will generate a protection error.
Likewise, any attempt to load a data segment register as an executable
segment will also generate an exception. The CPU enforces these &quot;protection&quot;
rules very strictly. If the descriptor table entry passes all the tests,
then the descriptor cache register gets loaded. 
<HR></P>

<H1>DESCRIPTOR CACHE REGISTER ANOMALIES</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>Anomalies exist in the real mode handling of the access-rights attributes.
Using LOADALL, it is possible to prove that these anomalies exist by directly
loading the segment descriptor cache registers (access rights), then performing
a series of tests that demonstrate the CPU behavior. The tests provided
in DESCRIPT.ASM and its accompanying include files demonstrate that the
CPU honors the access rights in the descriptor cache registers, and with
the exception of CS, never changes those access attributes.Furthermore,
by setting access attributes for data segments that would be illegal in
protected mode (setting the executable bit), it is possible to observe
undocumented CPU behavior.</P>

<P>Each test subgroup performs the same tests as each other. Separate subgroups
are defined because each subgroup has a unique aspect that requires special
attention. For example, making SS read-only requires being prepared to
recover from a CPU RESET. Therefore, the subgroups are defined as follows:
1) DS, ES, FS, and GS; 2) SS; 3) CS.</P>

<P>DS, ES, FS, and GS require no special handling. The DS (etc.) test is
broken down into two sub-subgroups DS, FS, and ES, GS to allow access to
the data segment during tests where segment access is prohibited.</P>

<P>SS and CS require separate, special handling. SS must be handled separately
to accommodate a stack that can be marked as inaccessible (read-only),
or not present. Such cases will force the CPU to RESET, as any exception
will generate a double-fault, which in turn will triple-fault the CPU and
RESET it. CS and SS require further special handling to accommodate expand-down
segments. SS expand down is simple, but CS requires moving the entire code
segment into the expand-down area, along with any exception handlers --
and be able to detect if the expand down segment has been cleared by the
CPU. The CS test is further differentiated from other tests in the way
it must handle the expand-down CS segment. Not only does the entire code
segment need to be relocated, as do exception handlers, but the test introduces
the concept of CS_BIAS (called EXPANSION_BIAS in the code). CS BIAS is
0 in all cases except when the expansion direction bit is being tested.
CS BIAS is used to BIAS all destination address, including those affected
by IRET. When the expansion direction bit is being tested, CS BIAS is set
to the two's-compliment code segment size (-CS_SIZE) -- as this is where
the code segment will start IF expand-down is recognized in real mode (as
it is).</P>

<P>I have found that in real mode, the only segment load that causes the
access rights to be changed is a FAR JuMP -- which reloads the CS access
rights to real-mode compatible values (93h). The segment limit is still
honored, as is the CS32 (USE32) default operand size attribute.

<H3>(SOURCE CODE)</H3>

<P>I have written source code to demonstrate that the CPU does not behave
consistently with respect to real mode vs. protected mode. Intel documentation
states that the descriptor register cache's get fixed default values in
real mode. The source code demonstrates that the descriptor cache registers
retain -- or honor -- whatever values they have received from protected
mode, or by using <A HREF="../articles/loadall/tspec_a3_doc.html">LOADALL</A>.</P>

<P>The source code consists of many modules, and a batch file to compile
the multiple files. The two main files: <A HREF="../ftp/source/descript/descript.asm">DESCRIPT.ASM</A>
and <A HREF="../ftp/source/descript/desc32.asm">DESC32.ASM</A> must be
linked together. The batch file A.BAT will assemble and link these modules
together. Because the Microsoft LINK utility will not allow one to link
16-bit and 32-bit segments together (whose segment names are the same),
I have provided a utility that I have written to change the segment definition
bit in .OBJ files to USE16 or USE32. This will allow you to LINK these
modules together. Just type <A HREF="../ftp/dloads/CVTUBIT.ZIP">CVTUBIT</A>
with no arguments to get a list of the syntax.</P>

<H1>Descritpor Table Access Rights</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>The definition of these bits is exactly as that of the access rights
in the descriptor table, with the following exceptions:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The &quot;PRESENT&quot; bit becomes a valid bit. Using LOADALL, you
may load a descriptor cache register whose P bit is marked not present
(P=0). During normal CPU operaion, simply loading the segment selector
with a descriptor table entry whose P=0 will cause an exception-11. This
is different that operating with LOADALL. LOADALL will let you load the
descriptor cache register with P=0. But any memory reference using that
segment selector will cause exception-13.</LI>

<LI>The DPL field for SS &amp; CS descriptors determine the CPL.</LI>

<LI>The DPL field for DS, ES, FS, &amp; GS should be 3.</LI>

<LI>The Granularity (G) bit has no effect on the limit field in the descriptor
cache register</LI>

<LI>A Code segment (CS) may be Read/Write/Executable by setting the access
rights as a Read/Write/Data segment. This will even work in protected mode.</LI>
</OL>
