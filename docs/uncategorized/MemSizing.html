<h2><font color="#FF0000">The Concepts of Sizing Memory</font></h2>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="60%">The concepts of memory
        sizing wouldn't be complete without an explanation of how
        RAM works. Think of memory as a square, two-dimensional
        array; there are as many columns as rows. Each element in
        the array represents a bit (not byte) of memory. To
        address an individual bit in the array, we provide the
        RAM chip with a row address and a column address. To
        minimize the number of pins on the chip, RAM chips have
        only one set of address pins, and uses them for both row
        and column addresses (<a
        href="../../articles/memsize/MemSizing.html#Fig1">see
        figure 1</a>). The memory controller must provide signals
        telling the RAM chip when the row address is valid via
        the Row Address Strobe (RAS), and when the column address
        is valid via the Column Address Strobe (CAS). The concept
        of using a single set of address lines for both row and
        column addressing is called multiplexing (MUX). As a
        result of multiplexing the address lines, RAM chip sizes
        are always a square power of 2 (or even multiple of 2).
        Chips with 8 address lines hold 64k bits of information
        ((2<sup>8</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = 65536); 9 address lines
        yield 256k chips ((2<sup>9</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = 262144),
        10 address lines yield 1M chips, and so on.<p>Now, armed
        with this information, we can discuss the relationship
        between the CPU address bus and the memory address bus.
        The CPU has 24 address pins if it is a '286, and 32
        address pins if it's the '386, '486, or Pentium; 36
        address pins if it's a Pentium Pro. The RAM chips
        obviously have far fewer address pins than the CPU; so to
        convert the CPU address to RAM RAS &amp; CAS addresses,
        the CPU address bus enters a memory controller. The
        memory controller converts the CPU address signals to RAS
        addresses, CAS addresses, and BANK addresses (<a
        href="../../articles/memsize/MemSizing.html#Banks">more
        on BANK addressing</a> later). Let's suppose our computer
        was a '286 design supporting only 4 banks of memory.
        (Even though the 80286 is obsolete, describing it's
        memory configuration is perfect for this example.) This
        memory can consist of any combination of 64k, 256k, 1M,
        and 4M chips, but each bank must be populated with a
        consistent size of RAM chips. To support 4M memory chips,
        our memory controller must provide signals to 11 RAS
        addresses, plus 11 CAS addresses. This takes 22 of our 24
        address lines available from the CPU. The remaining two
        address lines from the CPU are interpreted by the memory
        controller to select which BANK of memory to access. <a
        href="../../articles/memsize/MemSizing.html#Fig2">Figure
        2</a> shows a hypothetical relationship between the CPU
        address bus and the memory address bus. According to this
        diagram, anytime the CPU asserts A00..A10, the RAM chip
        receives a column address. Likewise, anytime the CPU
        asserts A13..A23, the RAM chip receives a row address.
        CPU address lines A11 and A12 are used to select between
        RAM banks. Since our hypothetical computer supports only
        four banks of memory, when &lt;A12,A11&gt;=00, the memory
        controller selects BANK0; when &lt;A12,A11&gt;=01, the
        memory controller selects BANK1; &lt;A12,A11&gt;=10 the
        memory controller selects BANK2; and &lt;A12,A11&gt;=11,
        the memory controller selects BANK3. With this
        information, we can write to any row of any bank of RAM
        chips in the computer. In this manner, we can detect how
        many banks of RAM are installed in the computer, and
        determine the size of each RAM bank. All that we need to
        complete our RAM sizing discussion is some theory and
        algorithms to apply our knowledge.</p>
        <p>In our hypothetical computer, the memory controller
        multiplexes the addresses according to the size of RAM
        chips. <a
        href="../../articles/memsize/MemSizing.html#Fig2">Figure
        2</a> showed the CPU address bus/memory address bus
        relationship for 4M chips. When the chip size is smaller
        than 4M, the relationship between the CPU address bus and
        RAM address bus changes. In our computer, chip size in
        each RAM bank is programmable; therefore we need to
        determine the size of the chip in the socket and
        subsequently re-program the memory controller before we
        can have full access to all the memory in the computer.</p>
        <p>To size memory, we start by assuming each RAM bank has
        the maximum size RAM chips which are supported by the
        memory controller. In our hypothetical computer, the
        memory controller supports up to 4M chips. Therefore, we
        program the memory controller for four banks of 4 MB
        chips. By programming the memory controller for this
        configuration, we can detect when a smaller memory chip
        is installed in the socket. But before we check the size
        of the chip, we need to detect if any RAM is in the
        socket. RAM detection is achieved by writing to the RAM
        bank, completely reloading the prefetch queue, and
        checking the value we wrote. If we get back the value we
        wrote, we have sufficiently determined that RAM is
        available for that bank of memory. And then we can check
        the size of the chip.</p>

<p>To determine the actual size of RAM, we need to detect how
many address lines are connected to the RAM chip. Consider the 11
address lines on our 4 MB RAM chip socket. If our RAM is a 4M
chip, then all 11 address lines are connected (MA0 - MA10). If
the RAM chip is a 1M chip, only 10 address lines are connected
(MA0 - MA9); 256k has 9 lines connected (MA0 - MA8); and 64k has
8 lines connected (MA0 - MA7). To determine whether a 4M chip is
installed, we need to determine if MA10 is connected. We write to
MA10, then read back at RAM address 0 (MA0-MA10 not asserted). If
a 4M chip is in the socket, then the data we wrote at MA10, will
appear at MA10, and not at RAM address 0. But if the RAM chip
isn't a 4M chip, then MA10 isn't connected; therefore the data we
wrote at MA10 would have been written to address 0. Our algorithm
repeats itself by using MA9 for 1M chips and MA8 for 256k chips.
If MA8 - MA10 all fail, then it is safe to assume the bank is
populated with 64k chips, as we already determined the presence
of RAM in the socket.</p>

<p><a name="Banks"></a>To determine how many banks of memory are
in the computer, we test the existence of RAM for each bank. This
is done by writing to the CPU address lines that control RAM bank
selection. For our computer, these are address lines A11 and A12.</p>

<p>By repeating this RAM sizing algorithm for each bank of
memory, we can determine how much RAM is installed in the
computer. <a href="../../articles/memsize/MemSizing.html#Fig3">Figure
3</a> summarizes the relationship between Multiplexed Addresses
(MA) on the RAM address bus, and CPU addresses on the CPU address
bus. The CPU addresses in this figure are calculated from the
table of MA addresses. If we need to assert &lt;A23&gt;,
&lt;A11&gt;, and &lt;A12&gt;, then we calculate the CPU address
as 2<sup>23</sup> + 2<sup>11</sup> + 2<sup>12</sup> = 801800h.</p>

<p>To summarize: knowing the relationship between CPU addresses,
RAM row and column addresses, and bank selection addresses is
essential to determining RAM size and quantity. RAM Bank
selection is done by writing to the CPU address lines that are
interpreted by the memory controller as controls for bank
selection. RAM sizing is done by writing to the highest RAM ROW
address for a given chip size and reading the RAM at 0. If the
data appears at 0, you know the RAM ROW address line on the chip
isn't connected. Continue this process until all RAM sizes are
determined for each bank. At the completion of this process, we
re-program the memory controller for the proper RAM configuration
in the system.</p>

<p>Sizing RAM under program control is accomplished differently
than it was during the power-on sequence. During the power-on
sequence, the BIOS is guaranteed absolute control of the system,
and its resources. During this sequence, BIOS can guarantee that
cache is disabled so that it won't interfere with the results.
Under program control, we can't write a RAM sizing algorithm that
makes any assumptions about the state of the hardware or the
cache. If we re-program the memory controller, our program would
most certainly fail, as CPU address translation changes with the
RAM address translation. In determining the amount of RAM under
program control, we must use a different approach, an approach
that doesn't rely on knowledge of the hardware. This means we
can't re-program the hardware, the memory controller, or the
cache controller. Since we can't re-program the memory controller
(or make any assumptions about the existence, state, or
programmability of a cache controller), we must write an
algorithm that can detect the presence of memory without the
intrusion of cache RAM. Therefore, the algorithm must be able to
invalidate the cache RAM contents while checking for the
existence of memory.</p>
